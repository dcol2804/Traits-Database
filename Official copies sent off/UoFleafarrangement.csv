"1","Geijera parviflora","Australian-Willow is an attractive evergreen, 30 to 35 feet tall and 20 feet wide, with an upright, oval silhouette.  The main inner branches are composed of strong, wind-resistant wood and are directed upward, while the outer smaller branches are somewhat pendulous.  This gives a decided weeping habit to older trees.  Younger trees are more oval-shaped.  This characteristic, combined with the thin, narrow, three to six-inch-long, olive green leaves which droop from the branches, gives the tree much the same effect as a Weeping Willow.  Short panicles of small, creamy white, showy flowers appear in early spring and early fall.",NA,"Leaf type","simple"
"2","Quercus rubra","An adaptable, widely planted oak with a rapid growth rate, red oak will reach a height of 60 to 70 feet and a spread of 40 to 60 feet when open-grown, and is native to rich woodland areas where it will grow to 90 feet tall. Branches and upper trunk are marked with long, light grey longitudinal lines which remind some people of ski trails. Open-grown trees form a rounded crown which makes a nice shade, park, or street tree. Many communities use red oak as a street tree where overhead space is not limiting. Acorns are small and easily cleaned up, broken into small pieces by pedestrians or eaten by squirrels. The foliage turns a wonderful dark red in the fall.",NA,"Leaf type","simple"
"3","Carpinus caroliniana","A handsome tree in many locations, the tree slowly reaches a height and spread of 20 to 30 feet. It will grow with an attractive open habit in total shade, but be dense in full sun. The muscle-like bark is smooth, gray, and fluted. Ironwood has a slow growth rate and is reportedly difficult to transplant from a field nursery (although 10-inch-diameter trees were moved with a 90-inch tree spade during the winter in USDA hardiness zone 8b with no problem) but is easy from containers. The fall color is faintly orange to yellow and stands out in the landscape or woods in the fall. Brown leaves occasionally hang on the tree into the winter.",NA,"Leaf type","simple"
"4","Callistemon citrinus","The common name ""bottlebrush"", perfectly describes this evergreen plant's bright red flower spikes. Hummingbirds love the flowers, and the plant is hardier than most bottlebrushes. The flowers are followed by small, woody capsules that look like bead bracelets on the bark, and which last for years. Offered as a shrub, bottlebrush can be trained as a tree to 15-feet or espaliered as a quick wall cover. It makes a nice screen or tall unclipped hedge. Pruning to develop several trunks and removing some lower branches can create a fine small specimen tree.",NA,"Leaf type","simple"
"5","Nerium oleander","Oleander is a wonderful easy-care, rounded shrub or small tree, with long, dark green leaves and an abundance of single or double, sometimes fragrant flowers. 'Mrs. Roeding' has double pink flowers. Often trained into an attractive small tree, multi-branched oleander also does well as a quick-growing screen or large specimen planting. Planted on five to seven foot centers, a row of oleander makes a nice screen for a large residence or other large-scale landscape.","Mrs. Roeding","Leaf type","simple"
"6","Delonix regia","This many-branched, broad, spreading, flat-crowned deciduous tree is well-known for its brilliant display of red-orange bloom, literally covering the tree tops from May to July. There is nothing like a Royal Poinciana (or better yet, a group of them) in full bloom. The fine, soft, delicate leaflets afford dappled shade during the remainder of the growing season, making Royal Poinciana a favorite shade tree or freestanding specimens in large, open lawns. The tree is often broader than tall, growing about 40 feet high and 60 feet wide. Trunks can become as large as 50 inches or more in diameter. Eighteen-inch-long, dark brown seed pods hang on the tree throughout the winter, then fall on the ground in spring creating a nuisance.",NA,"Leaf type","bipinnately compound"
"7","Cupressus macrocarpa","Monterey cypress thrive near the sea on the west coast of the United States, where it is native to the Monterey Bay, California, area. It has a high wind tolerance, becoming increasingly more attractive under heavy wind conditions. Narrow and pyramid-shaped when young, monterey cypress spreads with age, and can become 70 to 90 feet in height. It is one of the major trees planted to hold the sands in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, but unfortunately many are dying. The plant is only grown in the western states.",NA,"Leaf type","simple"
"8","Sapium sebiferum","With oval, pointed, deciduous leaves and an oval, open canopy, Chinese tallowtree creates soft, dappled shade. The trunk normally dominates, snaking up through the crown sporting major limbs well spaced along the trunk. Enough light will penetrate to allow lawn grasses to thrive beneath this rapidly-growing, 30- to 35-foot-tall tree. Yellow, terminal flower spikes appear in spring and are followed by brown capsules which burst and fall off, leaving behind wax-coated, white, berrylike seeds, hence the common name, popcorn tree. These berries persist throughout the winter, even after the fluttering, heart-shaped leaves have turned gorgeous autumn shades of red, yellow or orange and have fallen. Tallowtree is one of the only reliable fall coloring trees for USDA hardiness zones 8b and 9a.  The new growth in spring is red-tinged. The waxy coating on the seeds is extracted by the Chinese for use in candles and soap and the milky sap inside the twigs is poisonous.",NA,"Leaf type","simple"
"9","Acer negundo","Boxelder forms a 40-to 50-foot-tall rounded canopy of very light green foliage edged with yellow. The unusual foliage of this cultivar makes this a difficult tree to work into most landscapes. The boxelder is an undesirable tree for many urban situations and in some cities, planting it may be illegal. The undesirable characteristics are brittle, weak wood, short life, susceptibility to boxelder bug, and trunk decay. But the tree will grow just about anywhere and therefore it may have uses due to its adaptability. The best thing about the tree is that it will grow on adverse sites where more desirable trees may not. If you use the tree, plant it for its quick growth, but interplant with more desirable trees to provide for a lasting tree canopy. Boxelder is native along streambanks over a wide area of the United States, grows along flood plains, and naturalizes quickly on disturbed sites. It may be best to restrict planting to these areas. It is tolerant of drought and was planted as a shelter-belt tree.","Elegans","Leaf type","odd-pinnately compound"

"14","Acer saccharum","This cultivar of sugar maple is very upright and compact. The tree will probably reach 60 feet at maturity in a landscape, but it will grow slowly. The crown spreads slowly to about 15 feet wide. It grows about one foot or less each year in most soils but is sensitive to reflected heat, and to drought, turning the leaves brown (scorch) along their edges. Leaf scorch from dry soil is often evident in areas where the root system is restricted to a small soil area, such as a street tree planting. It is more drought-tolerant in open areas where the roots can proliferate into a large soil space.","Newton Sentry","Leaf type","simple"
"15","Acer platanoides","This cultivar of Norway maple has a height and spread of 15 to 20 feet. The dense, compact, rounded crown fills with greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. Norway maple's dense shade and shallow root system competes with lawn grasses, and the shallow roots can make mowing under the tree a little difficult, but this is less of a problem on this small cultivar. The tree is easily transplanted, grows slowly, is adapted to a wide variety of soils (including alkaline), and has brilliant yellow fall color unmatched by most trees. It can also tolerate coastal conditions. Well adapted to street tree plantings where there are overhead wires.

"18","Abies concolor","One of the best firs for the east, white fir reaches a mature height of 75 feet or more but is often much smaller in the landscape, 40 to 50 feet. It has a pyramidal shape and horizontal branching with the lower branches drooping toward the ground. The tree should be grown in an open area so the lower branches can touch the ground. When branched to the ground, white fir will cast dense shade, which kills turf grass. The foliage is a wonderful blue-gray that appears much like that of the Colorado blue spruce. White fir may grow one and one-half feet per year with good growing conditions. This tree can take exposure and will withstand some heat and drought better than most firs. Abies firma is much more heat-tolerant, has green glossy foliage, and grows even further south into USDA hardiness zone 8.",NA,"Leaf type","simple"
"19","Acer palmatum","This Japanese maple has a mounded shape with an ultimate height or about 15 feet and a spread to about 20 feet. The dark red, simple leaves are finely divided into lobes, and the sinuses and so deep that leaves appear to be palmately compound. The slow growth rate makes this nicely suited to residential landscapes. Its popularity is due mostly to the delicate leaves that stay red for most of the summer. Leaves may turn to greenish red in the hot weather in the southern part of its range. The multiple trunks are muscular-looking, picturesque, grey, and show nicely when lighted at night. Fall color is reddish and less striking than other Japanese maples. The globose canopy shape looks best when it is allowed to branch to the ground. Lower foliage branches can be thinned to display the attractive bark and trunk structure.","Dissectum Atropurpureum","Leaf type","simple"

Hophornbeam has a lovely yellow fall color, and the small nutlets, which ripen in summer and fall, are used by birds and mammals during the winter.  Bark is an attractive orange or grayish brown peeling off in longitudinal strips.  The finely-textured crown casts a medium or dense shade in full sun, but is more open in the shade casting a light shadow.",NA,"Leaf type","simple"
"21","Pyrus calleryana","`Bradford' is the original introduction of Callery Pear and has an inferior branching habit when compared to other cultivars which have since been developed.  It has many vertical limbs with embedded bark packed closely on the trunk and grows about 40 feet high by 30 to 45 feet wide but the crown is dense and the branches long and not tapered, making it quite susceptible to wind and ice damage and other breakage.  However, it does put on a gorgeous, early spring display of pure white blossoms, and the small, red/brown fruits which follow will attract quite a number of birds who find them delicious.  Fruit set may be increased by planting two or more cultivars of Callery Pear together.  Fall color is incredible, ranging from red and orange to dark maroon.","Bradford","Leaf type","simple"
"22","Cercis canadensis","The state tree of Oklahoma, Eastern Redbud is a moderate to rapid-grower when young, reaching a height of 20 to 30 feet.  `Flame' Eastern Redbud shows double pink flowers all over the tree in spring, just before the leaves emerge.  Thirty-year-old specimens are rare but they probably can reach 35 feet in height forming a rounded vase.  The pink flowers are displayed later than the species and are sterile so there is no fruit set.  `Flame' Eastern Redbud has an irregular growth habit and is more upright than the species when young but forms a graceful flat-topped vase-shape or globe as it gets older.  The tree usually branches low on the trunk, and if left intact forms a graceful multitrunked habit.  Be sure to avoid weak forks by pruning to reduce the size of lateral branches and save those which form a `U'-shaped crotch, not a `V'.  Keep them less than half the diameter of the main trunk to increase longevity of the tree.  Do not allow multiple trunks to grow with tight crotches, instead space branches about 6 to 10 inches apart along a main trunk.  Yellow (although somewhat variable and unreliable) fall color and tolerance to partial shade make this a suitable, attractive tree for understory or specimen planting.

The mature bark is light gray, rough and corky and the small fruit turns from orange red to purple and is relished by birds. The fruit temporarily stains walks. Leaves are wider than Celtis laevigata and more serrated.

"304","Cercis canadensis","The state tree of Oklahoma, Eastern Redbud is a moderate to rapid-grower when young, reaching a height of 20 to 30 feet.  Thirty-year-old specimens are rare but they can reach 35 feet in height forming a rounded vase.  Trees of this size are often found on moist sites.  The splendid purple-pink flowers appear all over the tree in spring, just before the leaves emerge.  Eastern Redbud has an irregular growth habit when young but forms a graceful flat-topped vase-shape as it gets older.  The tree usually branches low on the trunk, and if left intact forms a graceful multitrunked habit.  Be sure to avoid weak forks by pruning to reduce the size of lateral branches and save those which form a `U'-shaped crotch, not a `V'.  Keep them less than half the diameter of the main trunk to increase longevity of the tree.  Do not allow multiple trunks to grow with tight crotches, instead space branches about 6 to 10 inches apart along a main trunk.  Yellow (although somewhat variable and unreliable) fall color and tolerance to partial shade make this a suitable, attractive tree for understory or specimen planting.  Best not used extensively as a street tree due to low disease resistance and short life, but is nice in commercial and residential landscapes.  Plant in a shrub border for a spring and fall color display.",NA,"Leaf arrangement","alternate"
