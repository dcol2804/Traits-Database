This species flowers in summer whereas Blackwood is winter flowering. Young foliage can take on a purple colour in certain situations. Grows in a variety of conditions though does best in well drained organic soil with an occasional extra water during the hotter months. Does tolerate a little shade. Can sucker if soil is disturbed. The timber from Lightwood was prized at the end of the 19th century for it's strength and finish. Foliage was used to dye cloth and make pulp. It also makes excellent fuel. Care should be taken when collecting seeds as dust from the pods can irritate the nose and throat."

"Plant_selector_plus","Banksia menziesii","description","Notes Uses: Tall erect Banksia with acorn shaded spikes of Pink and Orange flowers in autumn and winter.This plant will regenerate from a lignotuber after fire. Banksias often require fire to release seeds for germination.Banksias can be a little difficult to prune. They do respond well to light pruning but too much can result in heavy leaf growth at the expense of flowers. Pruning too hard into old wood may result in permanent damage to the tree..The flower spikes make an excellent cut fewer and is an important source of food for parrots.There is a smaller Banksia menziessii dwarf form available which grows to approx 2m which would be better suited to smaller spaces. This variety flowers a little later in spring."

The stamens act as catapults, releasing stored elastic energy in just 25 <U+00B5>s. The resulting movement is approximately 350 miles per hour (560 km/h), over half the speed of sound, making it the fastest known movement in the plant kingdom"
