"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Habit/ Form","M. communis is a medium to large cycad with a woody trunk which is 30-80cm in diameter and 30-150cm tall. The trunk is typically underground, but may be emergent where growing on shallow soils or on rocky sites. "
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Leaves","Sharp pointed leaves are 50-100mm, flat, pinnately compound, up to 200cm long.  Fronds are arranged in a gracefully rounded crown arching out from the central trunk.  Dark green coloured fronds  become dull with age"
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Flowers","The species is dioecious, meaning that female and male reproductive organs are situated on separate plants. Female plants typically bear 1-3 cones which are glaucous, erect, then drooping when mature, barrel-shaped and 200-450mm long by 100-200mm in diameter.  Male plants bear 1-5 glaucous cones, which are erect, then drooping after pollen is shed, cylindrical and 200-450mm long by 80-120mm in diameter."
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Fruit","The seeds are 30-45mm by 20-30mm in size, oblong to ovoid in shape and with an orange, bright red, or sometimes yellow fleshy covering when ripe.  Poisonous unless prepared expertly."
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Bark / Trunk","It can have either a subterranean caudex, an aerial extension of the caudex or a short columnar trunk. The woody trunk can be 30-80cm in diameter and 30-150cm tall"
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Vigour / Longevity","Well-suited to large pots or directly in the ground, it grows at a moderate rate and given enough water and fertilizer and well-drained soils, it will form sizable specimens in a relatively short time.  Long lived."
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Environmental Requirements","Locally abundant in wet to dry sclerophyll forests, in coastal areas they grow in sandy soils and in nearby coastal ranges they grow in gravelly loams. M. communis naturally grows in an understorey environment, in a temperate climate with warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters with regular rainfall, toleratesthe frosts occurring in some areas.   In cultivation it is suited to temperate and subtropical regions and has been known to survive temperatures as low as -8ÂºC."
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Hardiness","Tolerant of short periods of drought, reasonably cold tolerant. Can tolerate light frosts to -3"
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Soil / Drainage","Like most cycads, any fertile free draining soil will reward in a sub-tropical - temperate  understorey envrionment"
"Treemovals","Macrozamia communis ","Pruning","Remove dead leaves to keep the plant tidy."

"Treemovals","Phoenix reclinata ","Habit/ Form","Its natural habitat is riverbanks and swamps, although it is occasionally found in grasslands if the water table is high enough. The roots are usually in water, therefore it would be tolerant of waterlogged conditions in cultivation. It will also take light frost but this will affect the ultimate shape, making the palm dense and bushy rather than tall and elegant"
"Treemovals","Phoenix reclinata ","Leaves","Leaves are recurved, 2.5 - 4.5m in length and 0.75m wide. Leaf color is bright to deep green on 30 cm petioles with long, sharp spines at the base.  20 to 40 fronds per crown. The old fronds remain on the tree and become 'petticoats' as they hang straight down beneath the crown"
