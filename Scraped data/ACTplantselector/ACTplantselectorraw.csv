Fresh vibrant yellow flowers are produced in summer/autumn. This form repsonds well to pruning, either for hedging, screening or as a pot specimen. Grows equally well in part shade but sunny sites will allow a naturally compact habit."
"ACTps","Eucalyptus mannifera","Description","A handsome tall tree local to the Canberra region and used commonly as a street and landscape tree. Its smooth milky white trunk and fine foliage make it a standout tree for large areas. Hugely adaptable, hardy and fast-growing, this tree provides shelter for shady understorey plants and homes for wildlife. As it is a large, vigorous tree it is not suitable for small gardens, but makes a stunning large shade tree for open spaces, gardens and parks."
"ACTps","Ajuga reptans","Description","Evergreen mat-forming perennial groundcover (0.3 x 1m) with creeping stolons from the United Kingdom. Rounded spoon shaped green leaves with a purple underside. Erect short spikes of mauve-blue flowers in whorls in spring and summer. Useful as a groundcover or border in shady locations. Prefers a moist position in partial to full shade. Many cultivars available. Can be susceptible to fungal disease in high humidity. Divide every few years to reduce crowding and fungal occurrence.  Drought sensitive."
"ACTps","Banksia","Description","A dwarf selection of Banksia ericifolia, this compact shrub produces masses of large orange/red flower spikes in autumn and winter. Works well as a hardy but spectacular pot specimen. Great for attracting nectar-feeding birds. Grows slightly bushier with more flowers in a sunny site."
"ACTps","Leptospermum morrisonii","Description","An attractive tall shrub with striking burgundy coloured growth. It has an abundance of large white flowers during summer. Grows to approximately 3m high by 1.5m across. An invaluable large shrub for the Canberra region, for its hardiness to harsh conditions, and its usefulness for screening and hedging. Great alternative to a Pittosporum hedge, as its also fast growing, but requires much less pruning to keep it looking fabulous."

"ACTps","Libertia paniculata","Description","Libertia is a grass-like plant for moist, semi-shaded positions. It has arching glossy strap leaves and starry white flowers in spring and summer which are set off nicely against the mid-green foliage. Grows to around half a metre high and wide, and does well in most soil types. Frost tolerant. If the plant becomes untidy, it can be cut back hard and it will re-shoot from underground rhizomes. Great filler for darker areas in the garden."
"ACTps","Helichrysum petiolare","Description","Evergreen dense mound forming shrub (0.6m x 1.5m) from South Africa. Grey heart shaped leaves, covered with silver grey hairs. Small creamy white flowers produced occasionally. Useful for foliage contrast mixed with other shrubs and perennials. Prune to maintain compact form. Needs well drained soil in full sun. Prefers a protected position. Tolerates light frosts. Drought tolerant."
"ACTps","Syringa vulgaris","Description","Deciduous erect shrub or small tree (4m x 2.5m) from Asia and Iran. Smooth heart shaped leaves on arching branches.

New growth can be damaged by frost. Excellent container plant. Regular tip pruning and light applications of fertiliser produces best results."
"ACTps","Amaryllis belladonna","Description","Bulbous semi-erect perennial (0.7m x 0.5m) from South Africa. Fleshy strap-like basal leaves appear after flowering. Perfumed pink or white trumpet shaped flowers grouped on a leafless erect stem in autumn. Useful for mass colour, as a border or mixed among other bulbs. Tolerant of dry, poor soils, but prefers ample water when flowering. Avoid root disturbance. Drought tolerant."
"ACTps","Pieris japonica","Description","Evergreen rounded dense shrub (1.2m x 1.5m) from Japan. Glossy dark green leaves turning bronze in winter. Dense drooping sprays of white flowers in spring.

Spikes of lilac flowers in summer followed by small blue berries. Useful as a groundcover between stepping stones, as a border, next to a pond or as a shade tolerant lawn alternative."
"ACTps","Orthosanthus multiflorus","Description","A grass-like clumping plant that looks fantastic with very little effort and also brings a rare true blue flower into your colour scheme in the garden. A member of the Iris family, the starry blue flowers only last a day each but are produced in profusion during spring and early summer, so the plant is rarely out of flower during that time. It is a really tough plant that will benefit from a once a year clean up after flowering with the removal of old flower stems. Prefers semi shade, but will tolerate full sun. Mulch to keep the soil moist and to deter weed growth."
"ACTps","Daviesia mimosoides","Description","A beautiful local shrub, highly variable depending on where it’s planted. In the sun it can grow up to 2m, yet in the shade it will remain about 1m tall. Flowers in all sun-shade conditions, becoming covered in scented yellow pea flowers in spring. This is a lovely drought hardy shrub that thrives in the Canberra climate."
"ACTps","Eucalyptus apiculata","Description","A lovely slender small tree with decorative smooth trunks and fine narrow foliage. Creamy white flowers in small clusters in late spring make this tree a favourite of butterflies and other insects. This small tree looks fantastic in groups of 5 or 6 planted closely together, as the slender trunks are very attractive, particularly after bark has shed."
"ACTps","Exocarpus cupressiformis","Description","A small pretty local tree with weeping green foliage and red edible fruits. Has a similar look in the garden to a small Casuarina, but it has brighter green foliage. Great feature, hardy to our climatic conditions. Semi-parasitic, which means it requires energy from the roots of a nearby plant to grow successfully. Performs well in sun or shade."

"ACTps","Melaleuca gibbosa","Description","An interesting medium sized shrub with very fine grey foliage, and in summer is covered in small mauve bottle brushes. Requires a warm, frost-free position, so plant on a north-facing brick wall or place in a container in a sheltered spot under part shade. Useful for screening and informal hedges, requiring little maintenance."
"ACTps","Eucalyptus pauciflora","Description","A beautiful small – medium tree with a smooth white trunk, glossy green leaves and stunning red and yellow stems. Small clusters of cream flowers in summer. This is a relatively open tree, making it useful for providing light shade in gardens. The tree is extremely frost hardy, highly adaptable and fast-growing.

"ACTps","Kunzea ericoides","Description","A dense compact form of Kunzea ericoides. It has white lacy flowers and dark green foliage. This cultivar is frost hardy and slow growing, reaching aproximately 1 metre in height x 50cm in width. Best planted in full sun or light shade. Great substitute for English or Japanese box, as it requires less water, looks better through winter and is faster growing than its exotic counterparts."
"ACTps","Acacia genistifolia","Description","A small to medium shrub which may reach 3 metres in height. Like many wattles, genistifolia has flattened stems (called Phyllodes) rather than leaves. The phyllodes are narrow and rigid, about 15-30 mm long with a sharp point. The cream or pale yellow flowers occur in globular-shaped clusters from late summer to spring.  Because of its prickly nature, it is an excellent habitat plant for native birds. Great for partly shaded sites due to its showy flowers, prune for bushiness after flowering."
