Occasionally the flowers can be followed by pinkish, three-winged fruit. Pony tail will have a single trunk until they reach approx 1meter and may then sprout new shoots. This will also happen if the top is removed or cut off.Ponty Tail Palms can be used as an indoor plant in a pot if have plenty of light, florishing well in a heated atmosphere.   In pots Pony Tail Palms might only reach a height of 1m. Outdoors these ""palms"" prefer a well-drained fertile soil in a sunny protected position. Water well while growing and sparingly during colder months or the stem may rot. Little or no maintenance required, just the removal of old leaves which generally shed naturally.Very old specimens can reach massive dimensions, the swollen base up to 3.5 metres wide with multiple trunks up to 4.5 meters plus tall.

Bearing brilliant large, showy-red, staminate flower clusters during spring and summer this prolific flowering small tree is a great addition to any garden, large or small. The leaves are large, glossy dark green with a lighter underside and have a weeping habit. This tree is also ideal for parks and would be a strong feature in streetscapes. Suitable to most soil types makes it a versatile plant in many situations, tolerating frosts and drought once established/settled. Suitable to most areas in Australia. The beautiful flowers are bird attracting bringing nature to you. There is no pruning required as this tree maintains a good shape.The grafted ficifolia have a root stock more adaptable to different types of soil such as clay, loam and gravel making them more versatile than the non-grafted Corymbia ficifolia.Being grafted trees we need to ensure any shoots that develop from below the graft are removed as these will be root stock and may grow vigorously and overwhelm the selected Corymbia ficifolia above and you will lose the top tree and the desired flower of your selected colour."

"Benaranurseries","Gerbera jamesonii","description","Gerbera Garvinea Sweet Love is a robust Garvinea hybrid that are unlike any other Gerbera and are proven performers in sunny garden beds, borders and terraces! Coming in a wide range of brilliant colours, the flowers are long lasting, stemming from lush plants and can produce 100 flowers from early spring until the cold sets in. The Sweet Love has candy red flowers with an attractive yellow eye on glossy, green upright foliage.  Being very versatile, these lovely plants are ideal mass-planted, in cottage gardens, along borders and edges, in decorative containers, and make fantastic cut-flowers. The whole plant can also be brought inside as a temporary decoration for your entertainment and function areas. Weekly watering is generally enough once established but more frequently when hot and/or windy, or in containers. Very pest and disease resistant, this is a lovely addition to any garden. Mulching is always beneficial, and an application of slow-release fertilizer every 3-4 months. Gerbera Garvinea Sweet Love will grow to a height of 30cm and a width of 40cm."

"Benaranurseries","Gleditsia triacanthos","description","Gleditsia Limegold is an elegant, attractive deciduous medium-sized tree perfect for creating a shady, cool area in your garden. The foliage is compiled of graceful fern-like leaves which during spring and early summer is a lovely fresh golden shade while later in summer the leaves turn a cooling lime-gold. In autumn the foliage turns yellow before falling. Being deciduous makes this the ideal tree to cover a tropical garden as the dapled shade is ideal. The flowers on this thornless tree are inconspicuous green racemes which are produced in spring. After flowering large brown legumes are produced and these tend to persist on the tree well into winter. Being a vigorous grower this tree is highly suitable as a shade tree in many situations including larger properties, domestic gardens, also as street trees. This popular cultivar  is best grown in full sun and performs better in moist, deep, fertile soils but will tolerate a wide range of soil types including moderately saline soils, urban areas, coastal locations, air pollution, as well as some levels of drought and flooding; will tolerate poor drainage. As with most plants, Gleditsia is waterwise but water well until established, also mulching is beneficial to retain moisture. In the early years an annual autumn pruning of the long 'whippy' branches will promote a strong framework and maintain shape as a feature tree.Gleditsia Limegold will grow to 9 to 12m tall and 6m wide."

This native has an upright growing habit with densely packed foliage. This particular Grevillea is ideal as a hedge, perfect for your native garden, or as a member of your general garden. Popular with landscapers for mass plantings and ideal as a screen, it is also perfect for attracting birds to your garden.Grevilleas prefer full sun, they are hardy and drought tolerant, and will grow in a large range of soil types, including coastal areas. Will tolerate periods of dryness once established, but will benefit from deep watering occasionally in dry weather. Olivacea red is low maintenance although pruning after flowering maintains the desired shape. Feeding with a low phosphorus controlled release fertiliser in early spring or late summer is beneficial. Mulch to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.Grevillea olivacea red will grow to a height of 2.5 to 4m high  and 2.5 - 4m wide."

Each flower-head is made up of small flowers which are densely crowded onto heads or spikes with their most conspicious feature being the long styles which are first bent over like a hair pin and then straighten out. This bushy shrub has attractive lobed foliage and due to it causing skin irritation to some people it is advised to plant in an area where brushing past them can be avoided. Being a variety that flowers virtually all-year-round makes this a very decorative plant in any garden.This lovely Grevillea is very suitable for use as a boundary, in rockeries, cottage gardens, great as a hedge or screen, fine along fencelines, suitable for containers in courtyards and can be mass-planted.Robyn Gordon enjoys full sun to part-shade and as with most Grevillea, can tolerate many kinds of soil as they are very hardy and resilient. So almost any well-drained soil is preferable.As with most of these hardy natives, once estalished these tough plants require occasional watering during the dry hot months. Mulching to retain moisture and control weeds is an advantage. This grevillea doesn't require trimming but will tolerate a moderate to heavy pruning if required. Fertilisers containing phosphorus are best avoided.Grevillea Robyn Gordon can reach 2m in height and 1.5m wide."

As fruit ripens about late August they turn a bright orange-red over yellow background. The crop from this lovely tree can be so abundant they may need thinning to acheive the best quality fruit. The foliage is longish, slender, rather gracefull, and an attractive rich shade of green. The fantasia is also self-fertile. Nectarines are deciduous during winter, while flowering attractive pink blooms along the upright branches closer to spring, and during this season is an excellant ornamental tree perfect for the domestic or cottage garden. Can also be espaliered across a wall.The fruit of this above-average plant can be eaten fresh, dried, made into conserves and fruit salads to mention a few. Nectarines are a valuable  food source as they are low in calories and packed with antioxidents, nutrients, minerals and vitamins. Nectarine Fantasia enjoys full sun, 6-8 hrs ideally, well-drained fertile soil. Fantasia is also cold and frost tolerant and if you are planting during winter, if the soil is workable and no hard frost expected, it is fine to plant almost anytime. Manure enriched soil is welcome along with compost and mulch to retain moisture and deter weeds. Pruning is required to maintain shape and health of your fruit trees.Nectarine 'fantasia' will grow to 2.5m high and 2.5m wide."

In it's natural habitat this palm can reach 14' tall and can form clumps of similar width.Rhapis excelsa bears large thick leaves with blunt tips and wide segments on sturdy canes or stems which are covered with a fibrous sheath of course dark brown fiber.Rhapis excelsa is fairly cold hardy and can tolerate tropical and subtropical temperatures, handling both humid and dry climates.Being a prolific producer of rhizomes adds a fullness to the plant, although growth rate mainly depends on the environment and culture.This lovely 'air-purifying' plant is easy to grow, and possibly the easiest of all palms, tolerating low-light areas better than other palms although it prefers bright, indirect light, so near windows and skylights is preferred.Rhapis excelsa prefers a moist well-drained soil and drying out severely can cause damage to the foliage and tip burn.The best way to prune these palms is to trim off the lower leaves as they age or become discolored. If the new growth dies this usually means that the whole trunk will need to be cut out. It is a sign that the trunk has rotted so the other green leaves will eventually go brown and die.Fertilizer is rarely required as they are so slow growing. If the leaves start to go yellowish it needs some nutrients, so fertilize at half the strength recommended for other plants. Avoid over fertilizing."
