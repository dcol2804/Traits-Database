In autumn the foliage turns yellow before falling. Being deciduous makes this the ideal tree to cover a tropical garden as the dapled shade is ideal.

Being a vigorous grower this tree is highly suitable as a shade tree in many situations including larger properties, domestic gardens, also as street trees. This popular cultivar  is best grown in full sun and performs better in moist, deep, fertile soils but will tolerate a wide range of soil types including moderately saline soils, urban areas, coastal locations, air pollution, as well as some levels of drought and flooding; will tolerate poor drainage.

"Benaranurseries","Nandina domestica","description","Nandina domestica 'obsession' is an improved selection of the fine leaf form.Nandinas are an ideal addition to any domestic garden or landscape. These versatile plants are very forgiving of the many different conditions we expose them to. Nandina domestica 'obsession' has bright pure red fresh growth tips throughout the growing season where most nana varieties have lime-green. During the cool months 'obsession' holds the red new-growth colour for several months, retaining this red colour through most of the year. Don't be misled by the common name of 'sacred'or ''heavenly bamboo'', it is not a bamboo!. Nandina blush is an erect evergreen shrub with numerous unbranched stems growing from ground level. In colder climates they may be deciduous. The white flowers are borne in early summer in conical clusters which are well above the contrasting, colourful foliage. This variety of nandina doesn't produce berries, although all parts of the plant are considered poisonous. Nandina 'obsession' is ideal as a low hedge or borders, feature plant in cottage gardens or courtyards, great in decorative containers, as an under-planting for trees or can be mass-planted. As has been mentioned, nandina 'obsession' is very versatile, so full sun, part shade, even moderate shade is fine. 'Obsession' will also grow in a wide range of soils; free draining loams to heavier clay soils with good drainage. 'Blush' is also safe around bushland as it won't spread seed. It is very drought, cold and humidity tolerant. This is a low maintenance plant and requires little care due to being drought hardy. Mulching is always beneficial. 'Obsession' will enjoy a light fertiliser, particularly chelated or acidified iron, and if you need to tidy your shrub, don't trim as a normal shrub, just cut out the taller or unwanted stems from the base. Nandinas do not reshoot from the stems.Nandina domestica 'obsession' will grow to 60-70 cm tall and 60-70 cm wide.","description","Nandina domestica 'obsession' is an improved selection of the fine leaf form.Nandinas are an ideal addition to any domestic garden or landscape.
