It grows from 2 to 10 metres tall and is fast growing, but sadly can be short lived. Adapts to most soils as long as they are free draining, and can take some frost and dry periods. Performs best in temperate climate zones. A useful plant- the flowers are fragrant and can be used for making perfume, the seed is edible and the bark is rich in tannins. Green seed can be cooked like peas. Ripe seed can be baked then ground with a mortar and pestle into a low glycaemic flour."

Flower colour varies considerably, from very pale to vibrant yellow.
It is a low maintenance plant, likes a sunny and fairly well drained position, and can adapt to most soils. Can be pruned to promote a denser habit. A good pioneer plant for new gardens as it grows quickly and gives some shelter to your slower growing shrubs and trees."

This wattle is a hardy plant that will grow particularly well in warm dry areas, although it has been successfully cultivated in southern areas as far as Melbourne, but it will need a warm place. It is somewhat tolerant of frosts, however harsh winters in inland and southern areas can kill the plant. Grows best in a well-drained soil in sunny or lightly shaded positions.
Best grown away from native bushland because it does pose a risk of becoming a weed outside of its native range (inland southern and central Queensland)."

"Acacia lineata","description","The Streaked Wattle is a great adaptable garden plant as it is hardy to both drought and frost, growing naturally in dry forest throughout inland NSW. It has a dense habit, very bushy, and would make a great choice for a flower garden as it puts on a spectacular display in the spring. Its dense, bushy habit makes it great as a windbreak, for planting between trees and providing shelter for small birds. Pruning soon after flowering helps to promote a dense habit and prolific flowering."

"Acacia aulacocarpa","description","This Acacia grows to a small or medium tree, and flowers quite abundantly with rod-shaped flowers appearing from late summer to mid-winter. It grows naturally in open forest and can also be found in rainforest where it can grow significantly higher. Not seen so much in cultivation, it is nonetheless a useful forest or screening tree and produces timber that can be used in cabinet work and for a variety of other purposes.
The roots also fix nitrogen in soil, making it a great plant for reforestation of poor soils.
There are also two interesting varieties:
var. macrocarpa Benth. – occurs in Qld and NT, flowers very prolifically."

"Acacia aneura","description","This Acacia has a variable habit and can grow as a shrub (in more arid conditions) or a small tree (with more water available). It is often a profuse flowering plant with rod-like flower heads and provides light shade.
Livestock can eat the foliage, while the wood was used for Aboriginal weapons and tools, as well as for fences. The mulga has some other interesting uses, the seeds are edible once cooked, dried and ground, and are then traditionally made into seed cakes. It also produces a vegetative ‘fruit’ called the mulga apple, which is a swollen shoot caused by a wasp whose sting creates an insect gall, purported to have a sweet taste similar to an apple.
Great plant for dry areas as it is drought resistant, and also tolerant of frosts. It needs a medium to light well-drained soil and is tolerant to lime. Grows best in full sun, although can grow in part-sun. The roots of this plant fix nitrogen gas from the air in soil which is used by the roots as a source of nitrogen and helps deal with the poor soils in its natural growing environment."

"Acacia baileyana","description","This is a very fast growing small tree with beautiful grey feathery foliage and bright yellow flowers in winter. The winter flowering is often so prolific that it hides the foliage. The colour and texture of the leaves is a year round feature. This species does tend to seed itself so it is best not to plant it near areas of natural bushland to prevent it from establishing feral populations, however, in urban areas it makes a magnificent small street tree."

"Adansonia gregorii","description","The distinctive Baobab tree is an amazing plant, most successful in tropical areas, and not to be confused with the Queensland Bottle Tree, Brachychiton rupestris. Adansonia does not like the cold at all and will flourish only in tropical conditions, whereas the Brachychiton can be grown as far south as Victoria.
The Australian Baobab bears large, ornate and fragrant white flowers in the wet season, with the flowers opening at night. The tree will drop its leaves in the dry season. It needs very well drained soil in a dry spot. It can be grown in more temperate areas with moderate success if given a very warm, sheltered microclimate or grown in a container indoors. It is very susceptible to overwatering and root rot during dormancy (winter).
The fruits have an edible white part, eaten by Aboriginal people, it is refreshing and tastes like sherbet. The trees have a variety of other uses as well, including using the sap for drinks, and the hollows of trees collect fresh water. The young roots are also eaten.
Fresh seed will germinate readily, seedlings are vulnerable to damping off."

The fragrant white flowers are followed by blue berries. The new leaf shoots and berries have a mild ginger flavour and can be used in cooking, or eaten fresh from the plant. It forms a clump to 2 metres tall, and is hardy. Likes a lightly shaded to full shade spot, and can be used indoors. Likes water in dry spells. Grows from an underground rhizome, so the plant can be cut back hard if it looks untidy. Frost will damage the leaves, but it should reshoot once the danger of frost is over, though hard and prolonged frost could kill the rhizome."

"Ammobium alatum","description","Ammobium alatum is a showy perennial plant, with silvery foliage and abundant papery white flowers with large golden, contrasting centres. It flowers for a long period over summer, and they can be picked and dried, or used fresh in cut flowers arrangements. A hardy plant, though in harsh or frosty conditions it is best treated as an annual. It likes a sunny position, and goes well in a rockery, and is sensational for massed plantings and Australian native wildflower meadows. Propagation is from seed, division or cuttings. This plant is a food source for the painted lady butterfly."

They suit most soils including clay and can be grown in sun to part shade, though higher light levels give the best flowering. They bloom in spring with multi branched stems of lime green, which attract birds to the garden. They are also terrific cut flowers with their glowing green colouring and long lasting blooms. Simply cut the old stems down after flowering finished to neaten the plant. Feed in spring with any good fertiliser, as they are not phosphorous sensitive. They are drought and light frost tolerant once established. If heavier frost blackens the foliage, simply wait till all danger of further frost is over and cut damaged parts back to the ground. The plant will resprout from the underground rhizome, with healthy fresh growth."

"Anigozanthos flavidus","description","Anigozanthos Landscape Lilac is from the Tall and Tough range from Gardening With Angus. It suits most soils and can be grown in sun to part shade. Higher light levels will give  better flowering. Blooming in spring with multi branched stems of beautiful subtle shades of pale purple to lilac colours, they will attract birds to the garden. They are also lovely eye catching cut flowers. As the flower opens it will age to a pale green. It will tolerate wet spells. An easy care and fast growing plant which forms a large clump, if the leaves become damaged from old age or extreme weather conditions such as frost, and when the flower stems die off, simply cut the old growth down close to the ground. The plant will reshoot from the underground rhizome. This fantastic mid-sized Kangaroo paw will grow with ease and perform well for many years, bearing masses of pretty lilac to pale green coloured flowers from spring through summer. ‘Landscape Lilac’ has been selected for the great flower colour and for the way it develops multiple shoots quickly. As it is a fast grower, it needs some feeding and watering through the warm months to reduce plant stress, which can lead to leaf spotting. A good native or general purpose fertiliser followed up with a good watering will ensure good growth."

Cut the spent flower stems back to ground level at the end of flowering to keep the plant tidy. Feed with a good native or general purpose fertiliser in spring and water in well afterwards."

"Anigozanthos","description","This is one of the most prolific flowering of all kangaroo paws and it does it all year round. Bird attracting and great as cut flowers. The small habit and bright red flowers make a dramatic statement as a feature plant in the garden, for larger landscaping and for containers in smaller areas. Remove spent flower stems at ground level as well as any blackened leaves. Feed with a good native or general purpose fertilizer in the warm months, being sure to water well afterwards to prevent plant damage."

"Anigozanthos","description","This is a rather delightful smaller kangaroo paw hybrid that features red flower stems with bright yellow medium sized flowers. It is usually not a long-lived plant in the garden although a sunny well-drained spot will give the best results. An alternative is to grow it in a pot to prolong its life if your soil is poorly drained. Use it as a bird attracting feature plant. Remove the spent flower stems at ground level when it has finished blooming, and give it a handful of a good native fertilizer in spring, being sure to water it in well afterwards."

It forms a clump to 2 metres tall, and is hardy. Likes a lightly shaded to full shade spot, and can be used indoors. Likes water in dry spells. Grows from an underground rhizome, so the plant can be cut back hard if it looks untidy. Frost will damage the leaves, but it should reshoot once the danger of frost is over, though hard and prolonged frost could kill the rhizome."

"Alyogyne","description","The unique feature of this excellent shrub is that it is the first native hibiscus with a double flower (ie the flower has an extra row of petals). It is a fast growing medium sized shrub that makes a superb feature plant in either a garden bed or large pot as it is smothered in flowers from early summer to autumn. It is relatively tolerant of both dry or humid conditions and will thrive over a large area of Australia. Give it a light trim after the first big summer flush of flowers."

They bloom in spring with multi branched stems of lime green, which attract birds to the garden. They are also terrific cut flowers with their glowing green colouring and long lasting blooms. Simply cut the old stems down after flowering finished to neaten the plant. Feed in spring with any good fertiliser, as they are not phosphorous sensitive. They are drought and light frost tolerant once established. If heavier frost blackens the foliage, simply wait till all danger of further frost is over and cut damaged parts back to the ground.

Higher light levels will give  better flowering. Blooming in spring with multi branched stems of beautiful subtle shades of pale purple to lilac colours, they will attract birds to the garden. They are also lovely eye catching cut flowers. As the flower opens it will age to a pale green. It will tolerate wet spells. An easy care and fast growing plant which forms a large clump, if the leaves become damaged from old age or extreme weather conditions such as frost, and when the flower stems die off, simply cut the old growth down close to the ground. The plant will reshoot from the underground rhizome. This fantastic mid-sized Kangaroo paw will grow with ease and perform well for many years, bearing masses of pretty lilac to pale green coloured flowers from spring through summer. ‘Landscape Lilac’ has been selected for the great flower colour and for the way it develops multiple shoots quickly. As it is a fast grower, it needs some feeding and watering through the warm months to reduce plant stress, which can lead to leaf spotting. A good native or general purpose fertiliser followed up with a good watering will ensure good growth."

"Anigozanthos","description","Unusual gold coloured flowers with red stems on an extremely tough tall growing plant. A great garden and larger landscaping plant which has stood the test of time. Spring to summer flowering, which attracts birds, and is good for long lasting cut blooms. It grows from an underground rhizome, so once established, the plant can be cut back hard to the ground and will reshoot with fresh clean growth. Likes a well drained soil, flowers best in a sunny spot. Feed with a good native fertiliser in late winter to spring."

"Anigozanthos","description","Pearl has a dwarf habit with branched stems and prolific non-stop blooming performance. A reasonable garden plant but an outstanding kangaroo paw in a pot. Lovely, bird attracting pink flowers, which also make good cut flowers. Clean up dead flowers by cutting the stem plus the leaf fan that contains the stem close to the ground. Feed with a good native or general purpose fertiliser through the warm months and water when it is hot, dry or windy (or all three).

"Anigozanthos","description","A tall paw with large individual flowers which can reach 2 metres high. This paw is a strong grower that persists from year to year. Good cut flower and attracts birds that feed from the nectar rich flowers. Strappy dark green leaves.
Best in a sunny spot, feed with a good native fertiliser. Adaptable to different soils. Once established, it can be cut back hard to the ground to rejuvenate, as it will regrow from the underground rhizomes. Feed and water after cutting back to help the new growth, and if there is any danger of frost, cover the rhizomes with hay or straw to protect them."

Its domed shape is its very distinctive feature but it should be stressed that this tree needs a lot of space and should not be planted within 10 metres of any structures. It needs no regular pruning, however, the football sized seed cones are extremely heavy and present a safety hazard in public areas when they fall from the tree so warning signage should be used. The nuts are edible and tasty, the kernel has a tough shell which can be split in a fire or in boiling water. Can be eaten raw or roasted, and also ground into a flour. The timber is also valued for cabinet making."

Another interesting feature is that it is a relative of the Macadamia nut and has a large edible kernel in the fruit in spring. It is a low maintenance plant once established. It comes from Queensland and naturally grows on deep volcanic soils, so grows best in soil rich in organic matter and with regular water and feeding."

"Banksia ericifolia","description","This is a terrific hardy small shrub which can be used for low hedging and screening as well as a lovely feature plant, and does well in coastal gardens.  It has attractive orange flowers with maroon styles and whitish perianth from winter through spring, and they are highly attractive to large and small honey eating birds and insects. It suits a wide range of conditions and soils, including dry and partly shaded spots, where it will still flower. It is a very easy care plant, but extra attention will give great results.  It can also be pruned into a more dense shape, this is best done in autumn and after flowering. It is a more compact form of Banksia ericifolia, which is a very adapatable Banksia."

The glossy green foliage makes it great as a feature plant and excellent for screening, and it makes a lovely climber when grown over other plants or a trellis. Works well as a dense groundcover for landscape or garden use and can be successfully grown in containers and hanging baskets. Clusters of bell-shaped pink and white flowers are produced throughout Spring, making a gorgeous display and providing nectar which attracts native birds such as Honeyeaters."

"Billardiera heterophylla","description","A twining shrub which can grow to 4 metres tall with support. Grown on its own it forms a dense shrubby habit. It has clusters of pendulous blue flowers from spring through summer. There are also selections with white or pink flowers, and ground cover forms.  Grow in sun to part shade. It readily seeds, and can be spread by birds, so it can become weedy and invasive to surrounding bushland, so plant with care or choose a sterile alternative like Billardiera heterophylla x parviflora ‘Edna Walling Blue Bells’."

"Blancoa canescens","description","A strappy leaf perennial from Western Australia, Blancoa is closely related to the kangaroo paw. It has pendulous red or pink bell shaped flowers in winter and early spring, and they can have contrasting yellow or orange interiors. Like the kangaroo paw, they grow from an underground rhizome which will give the plant an extra hardiness from drought, and if it dies down the plant has the ability to resprout again. It is best in temperate areas in a sunny spot, and a soil with good drainage. Feed with a good native fertiliser. Tolerates moderate frost."

The wispy tufts of strappy narrow leaves can tend to get lost in the garden and are easier to keep track of when grown in pots, or you can place a label next to it in a garden situation so you don’t mistake it for a weed when it is not in flower. They respond to low phosphorus native plant fertiliser after cutting off the spent flower stems. This plant also works well in rockery type situations in the garden."

A hardier Boronia than the Brown Boronia, it can live for some years in the garden if it is given a sheltered position away from wind. It is also a good idea to give the roots some protection from heat and drying out- a large rock placed on the soil surface is a perfect way to do this, and additional watering in dry times. Likes a well drained soil, and tolerates moderate frost. It makes an attractive rounded shrub and is fast growing, tip pruning after flowering will help to encourage a more dense habit.

Native to the east coast, the form in the wild varies greatly depending on habitat — ranging from a prostate shrub to a small tree — in cultivation it is usually grown as a small to medium shrub for garden and landscape settings. The flowers are sweetly perfumed, making this shrub a lovely feature plant, and it’s hardiness makes it a good choice for garden and landscape use. Low maintenance and fast-growing, it performs best in well drained soil and will thrive in conditions from full sun to partial shade. Yearly pruning will prevent it becoming leggy and sparse. Great for attracting wildlife as the dense prickly foliage offers a protective shelter for birds and the flowers also provide an important food source for butterflies and other insects. "

A perennial herb which produces small clusters of flowers borne on stems up to 30cm high in Spring, it goes through a dormant period in Summer, storing nutrients in underground tubers for the following years growth. This orchid grows fairly commonly in its wild habitat across Western Australia, and is well suited to container growing in other regions. As a terrestrial orchid it requires a well-drained soil and good air-circulation, and will do best in a protected position with partial shade. The attractive strappy foliage and the unique delicate flowers make it well worth growing as a feature plant for gardens and courtyards, and it’s eye-catching flowers are also very attractive to native bees."

"Callistemon sieberi","description","Sugar Candy produces superb displays of pink flowers in early spring and then again in late summer on an upright large shrub. It makes a great feature plant or can be used for formal or informal hedgework as the new leaf growth is silvery in colour and a feature in its own right. The plants can be pruned to whatever shape you require but if an informal look is desired just give them a light prune behind the spent flowers and feed with a low phosphorus fertiliser for Australian plants."

"Callistemon","description","Callistemon All Aglow is a stunningly beautiful bottlebrush that is highlighted by pink to orange new growth and bright pink brushes with red undertones. All Aglow is an upright shrub growing to around 2.5m tall. It is naturally compact and free branching and is a perfect size for today’s smaller gardens. It also makes an excellent hedge plant as every time it is cut, it will produce a flush of the brightly coloured new growth – it can be cut as hard as you like to form the hedge you require. Like all Callistemon, All Aglow is bird and bee attracting and provides natural shelter for smaller birds. Expect full flowering in the plant’s second year. A good adaptable shrub. Tolerates medium frost once established, any damaged foliage can be cut back and the plant will regrow fresh new growth."

"Callistemon","description","This is perhaps the brightest pink flower I have seen in a bottlebrush. Forms a very compact rounded shrub that flowers prolifically in late spring and more lightly again in autumn. Great rockery, container plant or general garden shrub, and for informal hedging. It grows to around a metre and a half wide and high, and responds beautifully to pruning to keep it even more compact. It can be cut back hard to renovate it if needed, as there are dormant buds in the trunk and stems. Suits a wide range of conditions. Attracts nectar loving birds and insects."

"Callistemon viminalis","description","A useful new bottlebrush variety with a neat upright habit, lush foliage with pale new growth, bearing stunning large red flowers for most of the year. This large shrub to small tree is perfect for use in hedges, windbreaks and screens, and the tall narrow growth habit of this variety makes it the ideal bottlebrush for these uses in areas with limited space for planting. For smaller areas and hedges the size can be limited with pruning to height of approx. 60cm wide x 1.5m high. Very hardy and low maintenance with good frost and drought tolerance once established, making it an excellent variety for landscape and garden plantings."

The flowers appear throughout Summer after the strappy foliage has died back, making a great feature in the garden or landscape. Particularly suited to rockeries and containers. Fairly low maintenance, it performs best with regular watering and benefits from application of a slow release fertiliser in early Spring. Some botanists do not accept it as a unique species seperate to Calostemma purpureum, the common form of garland lily, however it is subject to debate. It is widely considered to be a separate species, and is accepted as such by the Royal Horticultural Society and the Australian Plant Census as of 2014."

The aroma of the fruits is similar to ruby grapefruit, and is perfect for cocktails and drinks, as well as cooking. Bears fruit from summer to autumn, with the fruits being ready to harvest when they come very easily off the branch without any effort. It is a great variety for growing in containers and in warm courtyards, and does best in full sun. Water thoroughly in spring and summer, especially on hot days, and particularly when the plant is setting fruit. Use a nitrogen rich fertiliser in spring and in late summer, keeping it away from the trunk of the plant. Prune to shape in the later spring months, lopping off any weak branches."

"Citrus glauca","description","Citrus glauca is also known as the Desert Lime, and this cultivar in the Citrus Gems range provides abundant yields and can withstand difficult conditions, particularly dry conditions, as this species originates in the Australian desert. In its native habitat it also grows on heavy clay soils, so makes a wonderful plant for those situations where little else will thrive, and with the added bonus of delicious, unique fruits! This grafted cultivar also allows you to grow this desert plant in the wetter conditions of coastal regions. The foliage is elongated and pale green, making it an attractive plant for the garden too. The stems have thorns to protect the fruits in their native habitat, but this means the trees also provide shelter for birds. The fruits resemble small lemons, with a strong, wild citrus flavour. The fruits have thin skins so can be made directly into preserves and pickles, and taste wonderful in drinks, as well as recipes needing a strong citrus flavour."

"Citrus australasica x","description","Sunrise Lime is a cultivar in the Citrus Gems range; it is a cross between the finger lime and the calamondin, developed by the CSIRO. This hybrid is similar to a kumquat in that the fruit can be eaten whole, as the pith and rind are sweet and the juice inside is tangy and fresh with a delicate floral note. The fruits are attractive, golden, the shape of a small pear, and appear in winter. The tree has glossy, dark green foliage and an upright habit, and looks wonderful grown in a pot on a balcony, in a courtyard, or in the garden."

"Corymbia ficifolia","description","One of the best gum trees for producing spectacular flowering, and a useful height as a shade and street tree. They can be variable when seed grown, coming in a range of colours from red, pink through to orange and white, and can have two toned flowers are well. They can also range in height from 2 metre mallee forms to 15 metre trees. If you want a known colour and height, it is best to get one of the beautiful grafted and named forms available, but seedling grown plants can give a lovely plant. If using as a street tree, the large gum nuts will need to be picked up as they drop so as not to create a tripping hazard, but this small inconvenience is worth it for the flower show, which also attracts small and large nectar loving wildlife. They are best in the southern states as humidity can be a problem for them."

"Craspedia globosa","description","A very attractive perennial plant with long stemmed golden globe flowers. Long flowering, from spring to summer, on a narrow rosette of leaves which are covered in woolly hairs. They naturally grow in rather swampy places, so need a moist but well drained soil to be at their best. Very frost tolerant, and can take dry periods and coastal sites. Grows from an underground rhizome, so if the plant dies off, it can resprout.
Propagate from seed, which germinates in a couple of weeks, normally. Great cut flowers, long lasting, stout stems, with an eye catching shape. Can also be used for drying. This plant has now been renamed Pycnosorus globosus."

It is the native turmeric plant, known as kumbigi to Guugu Yimithirr people of North Queensland, and the roots of the plant can be roasted and eaten. There is a white flowering form found occasionally in the wild.
Grows on rainforest margins and in shaded areas, and the plant dies back to the perennial rhizome in the dry season. Needs rich, well drained soil in the sun. It needs to be grown in a heated greenhouse in the southern parts of Australia, but apparently can be grown in temperate climates in a protected, shady position. If it is knocked down by light frosts, it will resprout once warm weather comes. Often the exotic Indian species C. inodora is sold as the Australian species, however the Indian species is much faster growing with leaves larger than 1m, the leaves having red bands and colouring."

Grows naturally in sandy soils, and a sunny aspect in well drained soil is best for cultivation.
The leaves are poisonous to animals, and the seeds also contain a poison, but are soaked by Aboriginal people to remove the poison before cooking them.

"Cymbopogon ambiguus","description","A great grassy plant for landscaping and for the home garden, Australian lemon grass is very easy care and hardy. It grows to around 2 metres high and wide, with whispy seed heads. It is drought and frost tolerant. Once established, cutting back the foliage will encourage fresh new growth.
The leaves have a strong lemon scent when crushed, and can be used to make tea and for inhalation. Research has shown that the tea is good for relieving headaches, migraine and inflammation, and aborigines also used it for chest infections and skin sores.
Propagate by division or by seed."

"Dendrobium speciosum","description","Dendrobium speciosum, or rock lily, is a popular and easy to grow Australain native orchid. It bears showy racemes of cream flowers sometimes with purple spotted throats in spring. It naturally grows as a lithophyte, growing on rocks, or sometimes as an epiphyte, growing on the trunk or branches of trees. It is not well adapted to growing well in normal soil, so should be grown in a position that is similar to the natural conditions. It can be grown in a pot with a good orchid mix and can also be attached to logs."

The graceful fronds are produced throughout the warmer months of the year once the plant gets fully established, a time when it is also surprisingly capable of withstanding dry spells. The fibrous trunk should be kept shaded while the plant is getting established and once the plant reaches full size the trunk can be used as a host for epiphytes such as orchids. The only maintenance required is the removal of dead and dying fronds once or twice a year and feeding with well rotted manure at the same time."

"Dioscorea alata","description","This species is a common food plant throughout the world, grows in northern Australia, and is now extending it’s range into northern NSW.  It makes an ornamental plant as well as being a good edible, with lush foliage. It grows as a perennial vine, and can grow to the top of trees if allowed, but can be trained onto a frame.  It can be used to also provide dappled shade for other plants. A great alternative to potatoes for the vegetable garden in northern areas, they need warmth and a rainy summer and dry winter to do best. Can be grown as far south as Sydney, as long as it is in a frost-free area. Normally deciduous in winter, depending on temperature, and this is a good signal to harvest the tuber, which can grow quite large.
Culinarily, they can be used for all the same purposes as potatoes, and more, including desserts. It grows from bulbils that grow on the stems, from cuttings or from pieces of the tuber. Be aware that it can be a weedy plant in certain areas, so dispose of unwanted plant material with care."

It occurs naturally along the east coast from north Queensland to southern NSW.  It flowers from creamy white to yellow in spring. It is epiphytic and lithophytic, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks in nature, but the home gardener can grow it on either of these or attach them to cork slabs. It does not like to be grown in pots. Water daily in hot weather but decrease watering in winter, which may help to stimulate spring flowering. Fertilising is not a necessity, but small doses of an orchid fertilizer in spring can help if flowering is decreasing. This plant used to be known as Dendrobium linguiforme."

They dislike root disturbance, so it is a good idea to apply a layer of leaf litter or bark chips to deter weeds. Tip pruning after flowering will encourage a more dense habit, as it has a tendancy to have quite an open habit. Feed with a good native fertiliser at the beginning of spring. Can be container grown if you don’t have a well drained spot. Good for protected coastal gardens, and can tolerate only light frost once established."

Careful pruning of this plant will lead to great results- if you prune while it is young it will encourage the plant to be more dense, but still have the unusual upright habit, making it great for narrow spaces and hedging. There are more grey leafed forms which are also very attractive. Naturally occurring on alkaline soils, in arid areas with light and sandy soils, if you have heavier soils it is advisable to form raised beds or plant in containers. Can be used for cut flowers, and is tolerant of some frost."

The flowers have a sweet and fruity perfume, and are followed by edible fruit with a creamy pulp and many seeds like a guava. They are ripe when they are soft to squeeze, and can be eaten raw or made into jam and jellies. The fruit can also be dried and crushed to use as a flavouring.
It is a tropical rainforest plant, but can easily be grown in any frost free area. It grows to around 3-5 metres tall, but some specimens can be larger still. It can have more than one trunk, and the handsome glossy foliage will have red-bronze colouring in cooler weather. Grow in sun or shade, and does well in most soils, as well as in a large container. Mulch well to keep the soil moist and to deter weeds.
The bark was used for making fishing lines."

"Grevillea juniperina","description","This is a very tough and easy care Grevillea that makes an excellent shelter for small birds, due to its somewhat prickly foliage and a profusion of showy, nectar-laden flowers. There are many different forms available that vary in flower colour and plant habit, from ground cover to medium sized shrub so seek out the form that best fits your requirements. For instance, more upright habits are useful for informal screens or hedges, and low forms are great groundcovers. The spiky foliage acts as a good deterrent for stray animals and people both large and small that you’d like kept off garden areas, but can make weeding difficult. Likes a sunny spot and is drought tolerant. Plants can be pruned to whatever shape you require as they will tolerate heavy pruning."

Great as a feature ground cover plant for rockeries and shrubberies as well as for pots. Can be grown on a range of soil types including heavier ones. Frost and drought tolerant once established. While it is an easy care plant, a little bit of care will see even better results. Light pruning will encourage an even more dense habit. Unpruned, it grows to around 1.5 metres wide, and 30 centimetres high."

"Hakea","description","This is a compact new type of pincushion hakea that features a spectacular display of flowers through the winter, at a time of year when not much else is flowering. The red and white pincushion flower heads make this a wonderful candidate as a feature shrub in the garden, however, its  dense growth habit also makes it a good plant to use as an informal screen around property boundaries. A good way to prune this plant is to cut the odd stem for indoor decoration when it is in flower as this will also help to maintain a more compact habit."

It grows to around half a metre high and a metre and a half wide, and can be pruned to shape, making it good for low hedging. Good for clay to loam soils as long as it gets reasonable drainage. A handful of slow release fertiliser in spring is beneficial. Also makes a great potted plant. Frost tolerant."

"Hymenosporum flavum","description","The Native Frangipani is one of the most useful Australian rainforest trees for gardens with its fragrant frangipani-like flowers, glossy green leaves and disitinctive upright pyramidal shape. It grows well over a wide range of soils and climatic conditions and does surprisingly well in inland and southern areas but it is important to protect seedlings from frost until they are a couple of metres tall. Generally, the Native Frangipani does not need pruning, which can damage its symmetrical shape, but it can be pruned to a desired size and shape if required. The delightful fragrance of the flowers is sweetly tropical."

"Kingia australis","description","A slow growing plant, native to south west Western Australia, Kingias are similar to grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea) in habit, except for the flowers. They have one or more trunks, 6 to 8 metres tall, with a large tuft of grassy leaves atop. A new growing point is formed if the main trunk gets damaged. The flowers give an interesting look to the plant, as yellow-green to brown round flower heads on stalks are held above the mop of foliage.
Transplanting of mature specimens is difficult. Best results are when the plant is given a good free draining soil, and is kept moist until established.
Kingias can live for centuries, and are slow growers. They put on around 1 1/2 centimetres in growth a year, so a 6 metre specimen is old indeed!"

Great groundcover for coastal areas, also suppresses weeds. It will grow in most soils, including sand and clay. Tolerant of drought, frost and lime soils. Produces an abundance of white flowers in spring, followed by berries in late summer/early autumn. The berries can be ripe even when green. The plant is pollinated by insects, so planting other spring flowering plants around will help with pollination."

"Leptospermum","description","An upright shrub growing to around 1.5 metres high and a metre wide, and has a glorious profusion of bright pink flowers in spring. It is a tough plant that will grow in a wide range of soil types and climates as either a feature or screen plant. It can also be used as an informal hedging and screening plant. Pruning after flowering will increase the density of the plant, and this is a good time to shape the plant. The flowers are nectar rich, and are great for floral work."

"Macrozamia communis","description","The Burrawang is a widespread cycad on the mid east coast of Australia, and is a decorative,  easy care and very hardy plant. A good landscaping and garden specimen plant, and will also do well in a large container. It is reasonably fast growing if given good conditions, regular watering in dry spells and a good native fertilizer from time to time. It naturally grows under trees in the wild but can also be grown in sunny spots. Male and female plants are needed to produce seed. The seeds are poisonous in their raw state but can be eaten after extensive treatment of soaking in water for a week, changing the water every day, with the resulting pulp cooked over a fire. Be aware that foliage can be spiky and sharp, so don’t plant near walkways."

Leaves look somewhat like a four leaf clover, with two pairs of leaflets. Grows in water up to one metre deep, growing from a creeping rhizome and reproducing through sporocarps. Great as a plant for the garden pond, it is an attractive aquatic species.
These sporocarps are used as a food by Aborigines, first treated to remove poisonous compounds and then ground and used for dough. It can be toxic to both animals and humans if not prepared properly. Sporocarps are eaten by birds though, including waterfowl, and the plant is spread in this way, among others.
Attracts frogs to the garden, as it provides ideal breeding habitat, as long as no pesticides are used in the water. Propagate by dividing plant root ball."

It has masses of small close set leaves, which look very attractive all year round, and comes alive in late winter to spring  with numerous small red buds which open to white flowers to early summer. The flowers are flushed pink in early stages, creating a multi coloured effect, and are good for cut flowers. It likes to be watered in the first year or two while it becomes established, but is hardy once it does, needing little care, but looks at its best with some care. In tough conditions there can be a branch or two die off, but these grow back once conditions improve. The foliage is pleasingly aromatic when crushed and is rarely troubled by pest or disease. Happy in poor soils, as long as there is no lime present. Frost tolerant."

The plant is quick growing, and likes full sun to part shade. Will do well in most soil types, and is drought and frost tolerant.
Propagation is by seed, which germinate in a couple of weeks, old seed (over 6 months old) has a much lower germination rate. Sow in autumn, as hot weather limits germination, and sow on the soil surface as darkness limits germination."

"Nymphaea violacea","description","This floating perennial herb with magnificent blue-violet blooms is native to northern Australia, growing in billabongs and rivers. The plant grows from a rhizome in the muddy bottom of the water body, with floating leaves and delicately scented flowers borne from late summer to winter in its natural environment. The plant can be cultivated from the rhizome, planted in a pot of rich organic matter and submerged in water 30 – 60cm deep. Cover the soil with a layer of gravel to stabilise. The pond should be at least 1 square metre to maintain water quality and contain some oxygenating plants.
The blue lily is a staple food for Aboriginal people in northern Australia, most parts of the plant are eaten."

"Orthrosanthus multiflorus","description","Morning Iris is one of those wonderful grass-like clumping plants that look fantastic with very little effort and also brings a rare true blue flower into your colour scheme in the garden. A member of the Iris family, the starry blue flowers only last a day each but are produced in profusion during spring and early summer such that the plant is rarely out of flower during that time. It is a really tough plant that will benefit from a once a year clean up after flowering with the removal of old flower stems. Prefers semi shade, but will tolerate full sun. Mulch to keep the soil moist and to deter weed growth."

"Pandanus tectorius","description","A really tough, ornamental and useful plant for tropical to sub tropical areas, it grows from a large shrub to small tree size. Native from North Queensland to mid NSW, it also grows on many Pacific islands, where the fruit and leaves are edible, and the fibrous foliage is used for weaving and thatching. The fruit is high in beta-carotene and can be roasted or eaten raw, and the leaves are added to jams and curries.
Growing on most soil types, it is highly wind and salt resistant, though not frost tolerant. Best in full sun, but will also grow in part shade. It has male and female flowers, and only females will produce fruit. It puts down interesting looking aerial stilt roots to help the plant to anchor itself."

Good for full sun to partial shade, and is best with regular moisture. A good plant for filling in between plants, stepping stones and paving, or as a low traffic lawn substitute. It roots at the nodes, so forms a mat of growth. The plant can be divided to propagate. Frost tender. The plant contains alkaloids, which can be poisonous to stock, but the bitter taste deters consumption. The milky sap can be a skin irritant to some."

Place it near outdoor entertaining areas so that the strong minty fragrance of the leaves can also be enjoyed as people rub against the plant or if there is a shower of rain. It can be a bit unreliable, particularly if the plant becomes waterlogged for any length of time. Give it a light trim after flowering to ensure the best possible flowering for the following year. It is a fast growing plant, and can be cut back by a third if a dense habit is required. It wilts when dry, making it a good indicator plant for dry soil. Watering will restore the plant to vigour."

Plant seed from autumn to spring and they will germinate in two to three weeks and flower from ten to twelve weeks after they spring up. Feed with a good native fertiliser and water in dry weather. Cut back old flowers and they will reshoot and flower again. Can be used for floristry work, and can be dried. Pick in bud and hang upside down and they will open as they dry and keep their colour."

"Ricinocarpos pinifolius","description","A delightful mid sized bush with attractive soft pine like foliage that showcases the abundant spring flowering, which occurs from August to October. The starry white flowers also make good cut flowers. It naturally occurs in heath and woodland from Queensland to Tasmanian coastal sites, and is a lovely feature plant of Sydney Sandstone bushland. It grows best in sandy soils with good drainage. A light tip prune after flowering will help maintain a good shape."

"Sannantha tozerensis","description","Masses of snow white flowers in summer combine with fragrant foliage as the outstanding features of this tough, long lived member of the gum tree family, Myrtaceae.This genus has had a couple of name changes, so you may see it referred to elsewhere as Baeckea or Babingtonia. It makes an excellent medium sized shrub that can be used as a screen or can be pruned into whatever shape you desire, including as a formal hedge (this, however, would require regular pruning). It is a tough, drought tolerant plant once established and will benefit from pruning behind the spent flowers at the end of summer followed by a handful of a general purpose garden fertilizer."

It is useful as background shrub or even as a low growing hedge plant that is very tough and adaptable but needs relatively good drainage. It can be pruned by occasionally trimming off branches to use as cut flowers, or else give it a light trim coming out of winter. The foliage is spicily fragrant."

"Toona ciliata","description","A large rainforest tree which was once common on the NSW north coast and southern Queensland coast, but was extensively logged for the prized timber which is good for cabinet making, as it is soft and easily worked with a beautiful red colour. Should only be planted in large parks and farms as it can grow from 40 to 60 metres tall, but is a beautiful tree, and one of the few deciduous Australian trees…the new spring leaf growth is red coloured and very attractive. In sheltered forested areas it will grow a straight trunk, but in a more open spot it grows shorter and more spreading, creating a good summer shade tree. Cedar tip moth can affect the new growth, and this too will lead to a smaller tree, often with several trunks if attacked early in its life. The bark is scaly and flowers are insignificant. The seeds are light and have papery wings which help them to fly on the breeze once the seed capsules open in summer. Likes well drained soil with regular water, and plenty of organic matter will see the tree thrive."

It is considered a weed in some parts of Australia. Produces both male and female flowers, the latter being the familiar brown velvety area on the Cumbungi. The plant is traditionally an Aboriginal source of food, amongst other resources it provides. The rhizomes can be roasted, new shoots eaten fresh and young flower stems steamed. The seed heads can be added to flour for baking, and contain protein. The leaves are useful for weaving into baskets, hats and mats, and all parts of the plant can be used for thatching."

"Viola banksii","description","A hardy and useful spreading ground cover for shady areas with charming small white flowers with purple markings. It has heart shaped mid green leaves. It spreads by underground runners, and can cover large areas if the conditions suit it. It does best in moist soil that has some organic matter, but will tolerate a wide range of situations. Though harder growing conditions can lead to a less lush appearance or even what looks to be die back, the plant can survive because of the underground runners, and pop back into life once conditions are better. Propagation is simple, dig up a section of plant with roots attached and replant where you want them. The original plant will regrow. It can be used for a lawn substitute if it doesn’t get much foot traffic and if it gets regular care. It has been realised that the plant commonly grown as Viola hederaceae is actually the original Viola banksii plant collected and named by Joseph Banks in 1770 at Botany Bay, which is more eye catching than the less common Viola hederacea."

"Westringia fruticosa","description","This is a very compact, free-flowering form of the extremely adaptable Coastal Rosemary. Its peak flowering is in spring but flowers can be found on the plant at most times of the year. It is a perfect option as a low growing hedge or informal screen plant, but its profuse flowering and attractive grey-green foliage also makes it suitable as feature plant. This is a truly low maintenance plant that tolerates dry conditions and poor soil and will still look good with zero attention, however, if you wish to use it as formal hedge it will need a light trim or two through spring and summer."

"Xerochrysum bracteatum","description","The compact, low growing form of this everlasting daisy, along with its very long flowering period are the key features of this showy, butterfly attracting native plant. It makes an outstanding pot plant for small gardens and courtyards or can be used as a flowering border for larger areas. Be sure to remove the spent flower heads to keep the blooms coming and give it a feed in spring and at the beginning of autumn to get it to reach its full flowering potential.

"Zieria cytisoides","description","With prominent pink flowers and soft grey foliage, this form of Zieria cytisoides is a great plant for a variety of situations. The foliage is downy and aromatic and the star-shaped pink flowers appear in abundance in late winter and spring.
It is best planted in conditions of part sun to shade, but if well mulched it can also withstand full sun.
‘Grey Ghost’ is frost hardy and will grow in moist to dry soils, as long as they are fairly well drained. Acid to slightly alkaline soils are best. Ensure the plant is well mulched, remembering to leave a gap between the mulch and the stem of the plant.
Works well planted as an understory, low hedge, or as an accent plant, and also makes a wonderful container plant. It grows into a well shaped shrub without even needing to be pruned."
