"Riyadh","Acacia ehrenbergiana","description","A common, large and spiny, desert shrub or small tree, on the Arabian Peninsula, A. ehrenbergianaA common, large and spiny, desert shrub or small tree, on the Arabian Peninsula, A. ehrenbergiana is known in Arabic as salam, and grows in groups in depressions and wadis, where rainwater runoff and fine waterborne sediment collect. The tree usually has multiple branches from the ground, with a greenish-brown, peeling bark, similar to that of Acacia seyal, with which it can be confused. In comparison, the whitish thorns of A. ehrenbergiana are longer than the leaves. Flowers are borne in yellow heads; seed pods are long, up to 10 cm. The tree has many uses in the desert: it is browsed by camels, pollarded for stock, produces an edible gum, is used for firewood and fodder; fibre ropes are made from the bark, and a liquid medicine known as Qataran is extracted for use in treating animal and human skin parasites. The heavy fluid is also used to protect the trunks of fruit trees from insects and fungi. A. ehrenbergiana regrows well from cut stumps, and can be propagated by seed mixed with animal manure, which helps acacia seeds to germinate better. The tree is famously used in beekeeping, producing good-quality salam honey. The trees usually grow randomly about 5 metres apart. One of the most drought-tolerant of acacias, it can gradually be weaned off watering altogether, after initial irrigation during the first year after planting. High growth rates occur during a heavy rain season. Owing to its drought tolerance, the tree can be planted in extensive landscape schemes, where a natural desert setting is the objective.","description","A common, large and spiny, desert shrub or small tree, on the Arabian Peninsula, A. ehrenbergianaA common, large and spiny, desert shrub or small tree, on the Arabian Peninsula, A. ehrenbergiana is known in Arabic as salam, and grows in groups in depressions and wadis, where rainwater runoff and fine waterborne sediment collect.

"Riyadh","Acacia farnesiana","description","Many of the acacias have fragrant flowers, but the beautiful scent of the sweet acacia in the gardens of Arriyadh in spring is unforgettable. A. farnesiana (known in Arabic as anbar or futnah) is a vase-shaped, small, thorny tree, often with multiple trunks and a spreading rounded crown. Its lacy leaves are evergreen in mild winters, but semi-deciduous after frost. The intensely fragrant, yellow puffball flowers emerge over a long period to open in Arriyadh in the spring. Native to the countries surrounding the Caribbean, the tree‘s blossoming can, however, be spoiled by late hard frosts. It has landscape value as an accent tree, especially in small gardens or patios, but can also be planted as a roadside tree, along pedestrian paths or as a background screen. Unfortunately, it has become invasive in some countries. A. farnesiana is extensively cultivated in southern France. A perfume is distilled from the flowers. Amongst other uses, the world over, the tree’s seed pods and bark are used for tanning and dying leather. Bark, leaves and roots are used for medicinal purposes. Sweet acacia honey is much prized. Gum exuding from the trunk can also be used like gum arabic. Trees are planted as fences and to check erosion. Its wood is hard and durable. Tolerant of most soils, it needs moisture to develop well during the summer and will respond well to deep watering. The tree is best propagated by scarifying ripe seeds and should be pruned regularly to maintain good shape and to remove any dead branches caused by cold winters.","description","Many of the acacias have fragrant flowers, but the beautiful scent of the sweet acacia in the gardens of Arriyadh in spring is unforgettable.

"Riyadh","Acacia ligulata","description","Endemic to Australia, A. ligulata is one of the most widely distributed plants in the country, occurring usually on red sand dunes. It is a dense, dome-shaped, and spreading shrub from 1 to 5 metres in height. The common name, Umbrella Wattle, arises from the fact that the lower 45 cm of the trunk is defoliated by herbivores. Its many fine, light-brown branchlets are often scurfy and distinctly yellow-ribbed. The narrow leaves vary in size from 4 to 10 cm; flowers are golden-yellow in colour, held in spherical clusters appearing mainly in spring. Long fruit pods are brown, often with a lighter stripe. A. ligulata can be confused with A. salicina, because it is closely related to A. bivenosa, and the latter two seem to have hybridised. Leaves and branches are used medicinally by Australian aborigines; the seeds and gum also as a food source. Readily germinates in disturbed soils. A hardy, frost-tolerant shrub, it will develop into a small tree with pruning. Tolerant of extended dry periods up to 8 months. Propagated by seed, A. ligulata is a fast-growing perennial on well-drained, alkaline and light to heavy soils. A. ligulata has been selected from the exotic acacias as having potential for planting in Arriyadh and is highly suitable for extensive landscape design. It is useful for soil erosion control, sand stabilisation, low windbreaks and is good as a fast-growing screen. Few maintenance requirements, but, owing to its rapid regeneration, the shrub may become invasive under favourable conditions.","description","Endemic to Australia, A. ligulata is one of the most widely distributed plants in the country, occurring usually on red sand dunes.

"Riyadh","Acacia nilotica","description","Usually referred to by its synonym, Acacia arabica or sant al arabi, owing to its occurence on the Arabian Peninsula. A. nilotica var. tomentosa occurs in Saudi Arabia in wadi habitats and rowdahs on sandy and alluvial soils. Single-stemmed, this medium-sized tree with its flattened or rounded crown is easily identified by the long, flat, straight, velvety-grey fruits with up to 12 constricted round seeds, which hang like peas in a pod. Young branchlets are densely white-tomentose. The tree typically has a black bark with cracks exposing a red inner layer, which exudes a sticky, reddish resin, well known as gum arabic. The long spines in pairs are sharp, while the leaves are only quite small: fragrant, fluffy yellow flowers appear during winter until spring. Very drought- and salt-tolerant, A. nilotica is unfortunately susceptible to freezing temperatures. All parts of the tree have medicinal properties; its twigs are valued as chewsticks. Tender pods and shoots are used as forage for camels, sheep and goats. Propagated by seed, which may require scarification, direct seeding is common practice in afforestation schemes. It grows rapidly in full sun, in dry, well-drained sandy or silty soils. After establishment, irrigation can be reduced, whereby occasional deep watering will stimulate growth and deep roots. Planted as a specimen tree or in groups in a desert or extensive landscape situation, the tree, with sufficient space, makes a beautiful silhouette. Unless frequently pruned to preserve its shape, the tree becomes leggy.","description","Usually referred to by its synonym, Acacia arabica or sant al arabi, owing to its occurence on the Arabian Peninsula.

"Riyadh","Acacia salicina","description","This native Australian acacia is a relatively tall tree with a weeping habit and graceful canopy of pendulous branches with long, thin and dark-green leaves. Occurring naturally in thickets and open areas, often along watercourses and floodplains, it develops into an upright, dense specimen with a clear trunk. Until now, this tree has rarely been seen in the Arriyadh region, but has the potential for more use. Blooming intermittently throughout the year, usually during the winter, the faintly fragrant, creamy-white flowers appear in pairs or clusters, followed by narrow seed. A. salicina is a vigorous, moderate to long-lived, nitrogen-fixing tree, adapted to clayey, alkaline soils, and tolerating poor drainage and seasonal waterlogging. It is moderate to highly salt-tolerant and hardy, but to severe frosts. Thriving in full sun, the tree is drought-tolerant, but the provision of deep water in the summer will encourage a deeper root system and good wind resistance. Propagation is by scarifying seed or boiling the seed in water. The flowers’ pollen has value in apiculture. Recommended for its foliage, A. salicina is an attractive tree for gardens or patios and as a street tree and in parks. It has potential for erosion control, although there is a tendency to sucker: this and the potential for its seeds to be dispersed by birds suggest that it could become invasive. Prune periodically to thin the canopy, to reveal the weeping character and to offer less wind resistance. The foliage is susceptible to insects and leaf diseases.","description","This native Australian acacia is a relatively tall tree with a weeping habit and graceful canopy of pendulous branches with long, thin and dark-green leaves.

"Riyadh","Acacia saligna","description","Often referred to as Acacia cyanophylla, its synonym, and commonly known by various names including Golden Wattle and Blue-Leafed Wattle, this tree is native to Australia. It may have been introduced into Saudi Arabia as recently as the nineteen-sixties for use in wind breaks and sand dune stabilization and was known first as cyanophylla, which describes its blue-green leaves. Very vigorous when young, it also has the ability to fix nitrogen with its roots. In some countries, however, it has become very invasive owing to the fact that its large quantities of seeds germinate easily, and that it regenerates after cutting. A. saligna grows rapidly into a small, leafy, evergreen tree with a rounded shape. It can be a multi-trunked specimen or have a single, short trunk. Its graceful, arching branches and attractive, long leaves or phyllodes give it a weeping habit. Large, bright-yellow, spherical flower heads appear in early spring and late winter, decorating the branch tips. Its seeds are stored in the nests of ants. After the ants have eaten the seed stalks, the seeds germinate. Moderately frost-tolerant and accepting most soils, it is a versatile tree that can be used as an eye-catcher in a garden, for screening, dust and wind control or planting in wide road medians. Apart from occasional pruning and good staking, it is easily maintained, although heavy root suckering can be a problem and saplings must be removed at an early stage. It can be used as a reserve of high-quality forage for use during drought, or as a mulch.","description","Often referred to as Acacia cyanophylla, its synonym, and commonly known by various names including Golden Wattle and Blue-Leafed Wattle, this tree is native to Australia.

"Riyadh","Acalypha hispida","description","The Chenille Plant is an attractive shrub, some 3 metres high, that originates from southeast Asia. A lush impact may be achieved by dark-green leaves of about 15 cm in length. They contrast well with the bright red, furry catkins. The latter may become up to 50 cm long, and account for common names such as Fox Tail or Red Hot Cat‘s Tail. Scattered blooming all year round makes the female Chenille Plant highly desirable for use in planting. It flowers most heavily in early summer.

It sometimes naturalises in favourable conditions but does not become a nuisance in Arriyadh, owing to a lack of water beyond irrigated areas. It can be used as an accent plant or flowering hedge. Severe pruning results in lush, rejuvenated growth and is an appropriate method to keep a neat habit. Its size can also be controlled by pinching the tips and pruning without damaging the leaves. It tolerates heavy and alkaline soil, but needs frequent watering if exposed to full sun. Partial sun and even some shade suit it better. Wind and low humidity may provoke dried leaf margins; these should be avoided by choosing the right planting location carefully. It is vulnerable to industrial fumes and urban microclimates. The Chenille Plant is rarely affected by pests. If grown indoors, it may occasionally be infested by scales. It should be considered that the plant is poisonous if eaten by animals.","description","The Chenille Plant is an attractive shrub, some 3 metres high, that originates from southeast Asia. A lush impact may be achieved by dark-green leaves of about 15 cm in length. They contrast well with the bright red, furry catkins. The latter may become up to 50 cm long, and account for common names such as Fox Tail or Red Hot Cat‘s Tail. Scattered blooming all year round makes the female Chenille Plant highly desirable for use in planting. It flowers most heavily in early summer.

"Riyadh","Acalypha wilkesiana","description","On suitable sites, these shrubs create dense mounds of showy leaves while the flowers are insignificant. Copper Leafs grow fairly fast to about 2.5 metres in height. The plant originates in the islands of the southern Pacific, where it withstands a considerable amount of salinity and still makes a lush tropical feature. High levels of humus and nitrogen are as important, as is frequent irrigation without waterlogging. However, fertilisation should not be applied until the roots have been established. Wind exposure and low humidity may result in burnt margins on the plant's main asset – its gorgeous coloured foliage. Hues in bronze, purple and red make these shrubs an eye-catcher. Hardwood cuttings are the most common method for propagating the numerous cultivars. In spring, they root easily in mixtures of peat and perlite under some shelter to retain humidity. Varieties differ in the colour and shape of their foliage. To achieve a bushy shape, the tips of young plants should be pinched occasionally. In winter, they do well with less water. A range from full sun to partial shade is tolerated, but a lack of light makes the foliage colours fade. They grow fast enough to sometimes act as annuals in colder climates. As indoor plants, Copper Leafs develop better in soil-less potting mix that retains humidity yet drains well, and daily misting should compensate the lack of high rainfall, as in their homelands. Grown indoors, they are also susceptible to aphids, spider mites and scale insects.","description","On suitable sites, these shrubs create dense mounds of showy leaves while the flowers are insignificant.

"Riyadh","Agave americana","description","Known as the Century Plant, this is the most popular of agave species, which are native to the southwestern United States, Mexico and northern South America. It forms freely suckering rosettes of about 25 bluish-green, fleshy leaves up to 1.2 metres long and 20 cm wide. The lanceolate leaves have strong, hooked, dark spines on their edges and sharp tips, which may injure unwary passers-by. A position at a distance from foot-trafficked areas is essential. It is best suited to a rock garden, where it tolerates poor and saline soils, drought and heat. When grown in a pot, A. americana requires good drainage. The tall bloom stalks with flowers reach a total height of 6 metres, or sometimes even 13 metres. It does not take a century for the plant to grow, flower and die, but it is an astonishing event anyway. The stalks, which resemble asparagus, may grow up to 30 cm a day and then branch into cushions of yellowish flowers. Bulbils or baby plants, produced on the flower’s stalk, can be used for propagation, as can offsets and seeds. At this stage, extra watering is beneficial. The flower stalk can be roasted and eaten. A. americana usually flowers when ten or more years old, after which the plant dies: the dramatic dry bloom stalk is sometimes left as an attraction. Agaves are very easy to grow in Arriyadh; they have bold, sculptural forms, and are a strong accent in parks and gardens. They require only low maintenance such as tidying up dead leaves or pruning unwanted offsets. They are sometimes attacked by the agave weevil.","description","Known as the Century Plant, this is the most popular of agave species, which are native to the southwestern United States, Mexico and northern South America.

This agave grows in full sun and, it is drought-resistant. It does best in well-drained soil with occasional watering, and other soils should be allowed to dry between water applications but before the plants start to wilt. It is well suited to containers and lasts for years in rootbound conditions. On the other hand, plants are vulnerable to stagnant water, especially when associated with low temperatures. Hard frost is not tolerated and immediately results in wilted leaves that do not recover. Plants are rarely infested by diseases or pests, but in adverse conditions they may be afflicted by scale.

It is, however, very susceptible to frost: it will survive, but recovers only slowly. A. attenuata is, nevertheless, a very attractive and successful agave in Riyadh, because of its tropical appearance and soft green clumps of rosettes. Planting agaves in bellied pots with narrow rims should be avoided, for removal of the plant is impossible without killing the plant or destroying the pot.","description","For those who like the appearance of agaves, but fear the sharp spines, this species is the best choice.

The bright-green, fine, feathery leaves are evergreen, elliptical and pinnately compound, with 10–18 pairs of 2-cm oblong leaflets. The leaflets close up at night. The Tamarind drops its leaves in dry seasons. It flowers inconspicuously, with red and yellow elongated flowers borne in small racemes. The velvety, cinnamon-brown pods are up to 15 cm long, sausage-shaped and constricted between the seeds. The fleshy, juicy pulp surrounding the seeds is both sweet and sour. Highly wind-resistant, the tree grows best in full sun in clay, loam, deep alluvial and acidic soils, as well as on limestone, and is moderately salt-tolerant. It is also frost-sensitive; young trees should be protected from cold. Although fairly drought-tolerant, the Tamarind needs regular irrigation. Propagation is by seed and also from cuttings, or air-layering. One of the major pests is the Oriental yellow scale, as well as several other scale species and insects such as mealybugs, nematodes, caterpillars, whitefly, thrips, cow bugs and the tamarind beetle. A bacterial leaf-spot may also occur. Tamarinds are grown as ornamental shade and street trees, and for their edible pods: beautiful and fine-textured, they make excellent specimen trees.

"Riyadh","Aloe vera","description","Since ancient times, the medicinal Aloe has been planted for its numerous healing qualities. Its exact origin is said to be northern Africa. It is often found on farms and in gardens in the Arriyadh area. Compounds of medicinal Aloe ease the healing of wounds. Upright, succulent leaves form dense rosettes of a bluish-green hue. To cope with drought, they even turn dull red. The small serrations along the margins do not present a hazard. Leaves form basal rosettes of about 60 cm height. In spring, yellow flowers grow like torches increasing the plant’s height to some 90 cm. These are followed by capsules later on. Pollination is performed by bees and birds; self-pollination is not possible. Heat and sun are no problem, and clumps become wider, even if neglected. For a handsome appearance, they should be groomed occasionally by removing dead leaves and floral stalks. The Aloe can easily be grown in well-drained containers. Potting soil should consist mainly of coarse sand, alkaline garden soil and some humus. Fertilisation is best provided by slow-releasing granules that are added to the soil in early spring and again in summer. Dividing Aloe clumps brings many offsets – the easy and quick way to achieve new plants. Seeds germinate easily too, but obviously take more time to show results. The seeds are ripe when the capsule is dry. It splits open to release winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Seedlings demand good ventilation and are quickly killed by overwatering. Pests are rare, but scale or mealybugs sometimes infest it.","description","Since ancient times, the medicinal Aloe has been planted for its numerous healing qualities.

The Amaranths originate in tropical Asia, but are even to be found in Mexico in dry desert areas. In Arriyadh, a strain of A. tricolor with its dark red to purple leaves is often to be seen on farms, and, owing to its copious seed production and easy germination, the plants seem to have escaped their agricultural environment and now appear as ornamental plants in many places. Usually an erect, bushy annual with ovate, pointed to rounded leaves up to 5 cm long, the whitish-green flowers produce very small, black or red-brown seeds. These fast-growing plants can also be grown as perennials, requiring full sun to partial shade, and reach a height of 80 cm. Not very frost-hardy, they require water until establishment, but are otherwise quite drought-tolerant. Seed should be sown in spring in fertile, well-drained garden soil, although they will also do well on poor soils. Plants are subject to attacks by aphids. Amaranthus is used as a leaf vegetable, comparable to spinach: the leaves can be eaten raw or boiled and young stems can be served like asparagus. They also have medicinal properties and are rich in minerals and vitamins. As an ornamental in the garden with its attractive coloured leaves, A. tricolor makes a great impact in borders or in large planters.","description","The genus Amaranthus contains about 70 species, which are generally grown for their colourful, edible leaves and long pendulous flowers reminiscent of a fox’s tail.

"Riyadh","Aptenia cordifolia","description","This succulent perennial groundcover is native to South Africa and belongs to the ice plant family (Aizoaceae, formerly Mesembryanthemaceae). It retains its fleshy leaves all year round. They are heart-shaped, about 3 cm long and their bright green contrasts well with the tiny but numerous magenta flowers that appear in summer and autumn. They consist of string-like petals that enclose a small white centre, and open only during sunshine when they attract bees and butterflies. Flowers are borne in the leaf axils and develop into capsules about 1 cm in size. Plants will not exceed 10 cm height, but stems quickly grow to 60 cm in length. It tolerates full sun when the soil is gritty and not too dry. Even though its succulent leaves store water, A. cordifolia does not revel in heat or reflected sun. The plants may even become cholorotic and can eventually expose unsightly bare twigs that will not recover properly. Light frosts, as may occur in Arriyadh, do not harm this plant. In rock gardens, it makes an excellent groundcover. It does well in containers too, where it looks best spilling over the edge. Pruning is easy and possible at any time. Propagation by cuttings is simple and seeds also germinate well. There are variegated types or cultivars with different blossom colours such as white, yellow, red and violet. A. cordifolia is best planted in small areas in Arriyadh, where it can be used as a groundcover, in a rockery, a hanging basket or cascading over the edge of a container.","description","This succulent perennial groundcover is native to South Africa and belongs to the ice plant family (Aizoaceae, formerly Mesembryanthemaceae).

It is one of the most desirable of small trees with a fast growth, reaching a maximum height of 6 to 10 metres, and a similar width. There are many rather isolated occurrences of the tree in Arriyadh, but it will really look its best only in a protected environment with shelter, high relative humidity and frequent irrigation. Foliage remains on the tree in mild winters, to be shed when the extraordinary flowers appear. Cold winters may induce a brief period of dormancy when the twigs become bare. Inflorescences resemble orchids in colours from pink to magenta. They measure some 12 cm across, attract bees and emit a light fragrance. Its fruits are brown pods 30 cm in length, filled with spherical seeds. These easily germinate in sandy soil. The light-green leaves are bi-lobed, like a camel’s foot. They sprout soon after flowering begins. Growth habit is an open canopy with arched branches, and Butterfly Trees are often multi-stemmed or grow as a shrub. The plants should not be exposed to wind. Pruning in winter is possible to achieve the desired shape and it is recommended for young plants in particular. Frequent irrigation, sufficient nutrients, good drainage and full sun will ensure a good appearance. It will survive drought, but becomes stunted and will not flower if humidity is too low.

In their natural habitat they reach a height of up to 50 metres, but in cultivation they usually grow no higher than 25 metres. Wide-spreading branches emanate from straight trunks. Both are covered by pointed, conical prickles. The deciduous leaves are pinnate, consisting of about seven oval leaflets of 20 cm in length. When they are shed, the showy flowers appear. Red, pink or white petals form a cup with protruding black anthers, and make this tree an eye-catcher in winter. For about four weeks, the 12-cm wide flowers draw attention when most other trees go dormant. A single flower is short-lived, but new buds develop during the flowering period. Trees should not be located where littered fallen flowers will bother pedestrians. Silk Cotton trees tolerate heat, but require good irrigation and deep, fertile soil. They are highly ornamental specimen trees for public parks and have occasionally been planted in parks and large gardens in Arriyadh, where they have grown well under good conditions. Bombax received its common name thanks to the silky floss that encloses the numerous seeds embedded in a woody capsule. These fibres, known as kapok, are used to stuff pillows. The calyces may be cooked as a vegetable,  and the roots have stimulant effects. The gum may be used as an astringent. Hardwood cuttings and air layering are possible methods of propagation, but are less frequently used than sowing the black seeds.","description","The impressive Silk Cotton trees, or shagarit al harir in Arabic, originate in India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

It provides vivid splashes of colour in an arid environment and grows well in Arriyadh, although it will tolerate only a few degrees below freezing. On appropriate supports, it may reach a height of 10 metres with relatively fast growth rate. It tolerates full sun, wind if trained well on its support. The plant’s vigorous nature necessitates frequent attention and the branches require strong trellises or pergolas. In favourable conditions, the foliage is evergreen, while the tiny flower itself is white and insignificant. Much more spectacular are the clusters of papery bracts that come in shades of violet, magenta, pink, red, orange and white. Good drainage, nutrient-rich soil and frequent irrigation allow it to grow rapidly and produce a multitude of flowers from spring till autumn. During the winter months, the plants survive with little and should not be fertilised, in order to allow the plants to rest. Urban microclimates and drought are also tolerated, but at the cost of appearance. Bougainvillea glabra ‘Mini Thai’ is a dwarf variety with purple bracts. It grows slowly to a hemispherical, compact shrub 1.5 metres high and about 2 metres wide. This plant is best suited to growing in containers. Propagation is easy by means of hardwood cuttings in spring. Offshoots should be covered during rooting to ensure high humidity.

It is probably the better choice for Arriyadh, because it is hardier than B. glabra. This sprawling climber is well protected by strong, curved thorns on hairy, woody stems. Its leaves are smaller than B. glabra and shiny on top and soft and hairy underneath. They last during mild winters, but are sometimes shed if conditions are unfavourable. The specific epithet stands for the spectacular colourful clusters of white, pink, red or purple flowers that appear seasonally, especially in spring. Three true, pale-yellow flowers are surrounded by bracts that make the magnificent display. Dormancy factors such as low temperatures or drought seem to trigger flowering. Its vigorous growth up to 20 metres, depending on its support, demands frequent pruning, and branches need to be attached to a wall, pergola, trellis or strong fence. Showy Bougainvilleas may also be hedged. Clipping is possible at any time of the year, but severe cutting should be done after the flowering season in autumn. This species may even be grown as a bonsai or topiary plant. Full sun and nutrient-rich, well-drained garden soil suit it best. In pots or containers, plants should be given a soluble fertiliser weekly, except in winter. On north-facing walls, the lack of light results in few or no flowers.

"Riyadh","Brachychiton acerifolius","description","Australian Flame Trees have maple-like, semi-evergreen foliage. Showy red flowers appear in spring when branches are still bare. Like flames the blossom attracts the eye immediately. They are small but plenty, bell-shaped and grouped on branched, red stalks. They are worth waiting for, since trees do not bloom so spectacularly until they are 20 years old or more. Both flowering and durability of its leaves can vary from year to year, presumably depending on climatic conditions. The Australian Flame Tree is native to Queensland and New South Wales where it grows to a height of about 36 metres. In Riyadh it usually does not exceed 15 metres with about 10 metres across, where it requires shelter against hot, desiccating, strong winds. The straight trunk is covered in green bark that turns light grey with age. Young leaves emerge in pink and turn green as they mature. They are deeper lobed than those of maple trees. In late summer boat-shaped fruits ripen and release edible, yellow seeds. Australian Flame Trees thrive in full sun and deep, fertile soil which should be low in salt. The root zone should be soaked thoroughly every month during the summer. Drainage is important and some humus should be added, if the ground is alkaline. Phosphorus is important and irrigation should be stopped in winter to induce flowering. Due to its uniform appearance it makes an ideal street tree. Popular in parks, it creates pleasant shade for pedestrians. Young plants should be protected from frost. Established trees simply shed their foliage in cold weather without any further damage. A central leader should be encouraged by removing lower branches. Fallen spent blooms and seed pods may cause a litter problem.","description","Australian Flame Trees have maple-like, semi-evergreen foliage.

This native of eastern Australia grows as a spreading, evergreen shrub that may be trained into a small tree. Without pruning, it may reach a height of 5 metres and almost the same width. Its lance-shaped stiff foliage grows upward and exudes a scent of citrus when crushed. Young leaves are copper-coloured and turn deep green as they mature.

Flowering is far less profuse in shady locations. Alkaline soils and even flooding are tolerated, owing to the plant’s origin on riverbanks. High soil salinity results in chlorosis that may be cured by applying iron chelate. Pruning should not be hard, and care should be taken in shaping and trimming. Propagation is easy by seeds or cuttings. Cultivars vary in colour, shape and size: ‘Jeffers’ grows more compact with magenta flowers, while ‘Splendens’ is an improved selection with red flowers.

"Riyadh","Canna indica","description","Cannas are beautiful, herbaceous perennials, which provide a colourful display from red to orange and yellow, when their basic needs are met: rich soil with lots of humus and plenty of water. They originate in the humid tropics, where the more than 30 different types of Canna are native to Central and South America. New cultivars have been created, particularly those with almost black foliage, or very deep-coloured red flowers and variegated leaves. An outstanding feature is that they bloom almost non-stop throughout the year. The attractive leaves are large, broad, oval, veined and rubbery-textured on glabrous stems; the roots are tuberous rhizomes. Exposure to the sun is essential, although partial shade encourages stronger growth, and a lack of light may reduce flowering. Cannas may be propagated by seed, and the fleshy rhizomes of cultivars with their bright colours require division. All parts of the plant are frost-tender. Alkaline soils with a high pH may cause chlorisis. C. indica can be used as a potted plant, or planted in herbaceous borders, on the edge of ponds, and as a patio plant. They should be set about 50 cm apart and mulching the soil helps to keep in moisture. Clumps of Cannas look more natural than massed planting. High winds tear the leaves, and so a protected location is recommended, especially in Arriyadh, where leaf scorch could potentially be a problem. Dead flowers should be cut off to stimulate new flowers. Any ungainly leaves should be removed to the ground to encourage new shoots with lush foliage.","description","Cannas are beautiful, herbaceous perennials, which provide a colourful display from red to orange and yellow, when their basic needs are met: rich soil with lots of humus and plenty of water. They originate in the humid tropics, where the more than 30 different types of Canna are native to Central and South America.

Generally evergreen, the Emperor’s Candlestick’s leaves may be shed in cold winters, but frosts known to occur in Arriyadh do not damage the branches. Without pruning, the plants form sprawling shrubs up to 4 metres high and 6 metres wide. In locations protected from strong winds, they may be trained as standard trees that eventually form picturesque, umbrella-shaped crowns. Showy spikes of bright-yellow flowers appear at the end of the shoots; these stick out like torches, and give the plants another common name, Candle Bush. The inflorescences are up to 3 cm across and are borne mainly in summer, but last well into the autumn. Pollination is done by butterflies, followed by brown, elongated pods some 30 cm long. Seeds germinate readily, providing numerous offspring both in cultivation and when escaping to invade the vicinity. Another method of multiplication is hardwood cuttings planted in winter. Soils may be low in nutrients, but need to be well drained. To achieve fast growth and a splendid floral display, this plant may be pampered by providing sufficient water and fertiliser. This way, plants quickly form dense hedges suitable for screening. Hard pruning in winter leads to proliferated growth in spring. The plants revel in full sun and heat, adjusting their vigour to almost any condition. Candle Bushes are robust in urban microclimates, and are good accent plants in parks and gardens.","description","This Argentinean native is well adapted to desert climates.

The Golden Shower Tree, known in Arabic as khiyar shambar, deserves its name for a spectacular floral display in spring before new leaves emerge. Some pendant, yellow flowers still show up during summer. They are lightly fragrant. The tree grows slowly to form a wide canopy in time, reaching up to 10 metres in height and even 20 metres in its native environment. Often planted in Arriyadh, it does not always grow well owing the lack of humidity and to its susceptibility to chlorosis and frost damage. Its bark is pale grey and smooth when young, becoming dark brown and rough with age. The bright-green leaves are pinnate with pairs of ovate leaflets. Bright yellow flowers are borne on drooping racemes that may reach 60 cm in length. Single flowers are about 6 cm in diameter. They are followed by indehiscent pods that contain up to 100 poisonous seeds. It takes them about a year to ripen. When spent flowers are discarded, a second flowering may take place in autumn. The Golden Shower Tree grows in full sun but tolerates some shade, a little salinity and alkaline soil. Well-drained soil is essential and some drought is tolerated. Seeds should be scarified before sowing. In Arriyadh, its landscape value includes specimen trees in private gardens and parks. Falling seedpods may cause a litter problem. For frequent heavy flowering, terminal branches on young trees should be pruned to a side bud at the end of the flowering season.","description","This native from southern Asia retains some leaves during mild winters to shed these just before flowering.

C. parqui tolerates some shade, but does best in partial sun with fertile soil. Irrigation in summer is necessary, while it withstands some drought in winter after the leaves are shed. In early spring, it may be cut to the ground to renew growth which should be aided by an application of general-purpose fertiliser. Pinching out is recommended at any time of the year to keep a compact shape. This shrub looks good in groups and may enhance pedestrian precincts with its fragrance."

"Riyadh","Chamaerops humilis","description","The Dwarf Fan Palm is native to the Mediterranean area and one of the few palms that are naturally growing in Europe. These small palms are often seen in Riyadh, where they withstand occasional cold snaps with frost well. In the wild they usually have a single trunk some 4 metres high, while cultivated ones are mostly multi-stemmed. Unless trimmed the trunk is covered by remnants of old fronds. The fans are triangular spades 60 cm across and sharp thorns align the margins of the petiole that measures more than 1 metre in length. Yellow inflorescences appear in early summer at the base of the crown. Male and female flowers usually grow on different plants. In autumn tiny, inedible dates develop to 1 cm diameter with yellow, orange or brown rind. Dwarf Fan Palms are very tough and take full sun, wind and some salinity. Drought is tolerated by an established specimen, but stagnant water may kill it. Rich, well-draining soil and deep, regular irrigation are preferred. C. humilis can be planted very decoratively in Riyadh. They make striking accent plants in rock gardens and containers and look good in groups on slopes where they do not have to compete with larger shrubs or trees. In former times the fibres were used for making mats, ropes and brooms. Nowadays the leaves may be fabricated as a substitute for linen or as ‘vegetable horsehair’. Young leaf tips may be eaten as vegetables. Propagation by seed is most common, but offshoots can be detached from a clump. Maintenance is low: removal of dead fronds and unwanted shoots is occasionally necessary.","description","The Dwarf Fan Palm is native to the Mediterranean area and one of the few palms that are naturally growing in Europe.

To keep it neat and tidy one should cut it back by the end of winter and if necessary by mid-summer to remove the faded flowers. They are not produced during the first year, however, they are insignificant and by no means what the plant is grown for. Low humidity is no problem and little frost is tolerated without any damage. If neglected the plants may get leggy in time and require cutting back to grow new attractive shoots. A variety called ‘Silverdust’ is more compact and shows silver-white leaves. It also shows less or no flowers than the species. Propagation is very easy from cuttings. The stems are stiff and branch from the base. They make excellent cuttings to propagate the plant quickly. Dusty Millers do well in well drained soil with frequent irrigation. Deep rooting allows established plants to tolerate some drought. Under ideal conditions they may reach 1 metre in height and 1.4 metres width, but in Riyadh, where they are to be seen in both private gardens and public open space, these woody perennials remain about half this size. Pinching helps the plant to grow more compact. They are low in maintenance and free of pests.

A more common relative of C. colocynthis is Citrullus lanatus, the watermelon. The leaves are triangular, grey-green and deeply lobed with three to seven lobes. The branches are hairy. The small, yellow flowers appear in summer. The fruit is about 7 cm in size, initially fleshy and a mottled green with yellow bands. Older fruits are yellow, and rattle if shaken. The fruit was used formerly as a digestive, and the taste is very bitter. Nowadays, its medicinal uses are limited, because it can damage the liver. Propagation is by seed. It grows on sandy soil, is moderately salt-tolerant, and for landscape purposes little maintenance is necessary once established. C. colocynthis will not tolerate frost, but recovers during summer. The Bitter Apple is very useful for open land as a coloniser and slope stabiliser.

Nevertheless, they are not uncommon in Arriyadh, where, despite the possibility of strong frosts, they thrive on farms in environments protected by other trees. Large, white flowers in spring emit a sweet scent. After pollination, the tree bears rounded green fruits that turn greenish-yellow when fully mature. Deep-green leaves are accompanied by thorns at their base. Cultivars are commonly spineless and less acidic. They exceed the aroma of lemons. Limes require abundant sunlight, good nutrition and require humidity. Sufficient irrigation is essential in well-drained, fertile soil. It should be omitted in autumn, but wilting must nevertheless be inhibited. Some drought is tolerated if the soils are deep. Frost damages leaves and may cause branches to die back. C. aurantiifolia grows well in containers, near pools and is suitable for both public and private gardens. Commercially grown cultivars are grafted, but cuttings with heels meet private needs. Seedlings may show thorns and acidic fruits. Limes are prone to scales, spider mites and mealybugs. Pruning should be done in early spring before flowering. Severe cutting back harms both the appearance and the tree’s health, because wounds take a long time to be closed by surrounding bark. If their diameter exceeds 3 cm, the wounds should be sealed with a pruning compound.

Native to coastal and riverine areas of eastern Africa and Yemen, it is to be found all over the Arabian peninsula, although it is not often seen in Arriyadh. The smell of the fluffy yellow-green flowers in spring and autumn is unpleasant to some people, especially at nighttime, in winter and when damp after rainfall. The tree’s wood is dense and suitable for charcoal: goats browse on the young leaves. It is highly salt- and drought-tolerant, and planted in afforestation projects. The C. lancifolius tree also plays a role in remediating heavy metal and oil-contaminated soil. It makes an attractive specimen tree and has all of the properties attributed to C. erectus. Silver buttonwood (C. erectus var. sericeus) is a variety that usually grows as a low-branching shrub; under ideal conditions, it will become an attractive tree up to 15 m tall with a spread of 6 metres. The evergreen leaves are oblong to lance-shaped, up to 10 cm long and covered with silky hairs, which gives a beautiful silver-grey colour which sparkles in the sun. It has great ornamental value, and deserves to be seen more often in Arriyadh.","description","There is some confusion about the botanical name of this less common relative of C. erectus, and it has also been referred to as C. lanceolatus, C. latifolia and Anogeissus latifolius.

"Riyadh","Cortaderia selloana","description","Pampas Grass is the distinctive plant of Argentina’s grasslands; in Arriyadh, it withstands hot, dry winds and is frost-tolerant. There is potential to use this plant more, but it demands space. It grows to a massive clump of 2 up to a maximum of 5 metres high, and about the same width. Leaves are pale-green and may reach 2 metres in length and are 1 cm wide. They are bent down, giving the plant a fountain-like appearance. Male and female panicles grow on different plants and the females are the more attractive ones. In late summer and autumn, silky plumes appear. When dried, they make long-lasting, ornamental elements in arrangements. In mild climates, it is evergreen, but frost may force it to become dormant. Damaged plants generally recover when cut back to the ground, but are weakened if this is practised annually. Pampas Grass tolerates full to partial sun and tolerates drought and high salinity, but requires good drainage. Any handling must be done very carefully because the serrated edges can lead to painful cuts to the skin. To keep it from injuring pedestrians, it should not be located close to pathways or seating areas. Pampas Grass makes an impressive solitary plant or may be planted in groups for screening. It readily multiplies by dividing, and propagation by sowing is also common. Cultivars have to be reproduced vegetatively. Varieties show different sizes, such as the dwarf ‘Pumila’, growing to about 1.5 metres, or another flower colour such as ‘Rosea’, with light-pink plumes.","description","Pampas Grass is the distinctive plant of Argentina’s grasslands; in Arriyadh, it withstands hot, dry winds and is frost-tolerant.

Numerous arching leaves reach between 1 and 1.5 metres long and some 12 cm wide, and gradually taper to the apex. If damaged by frost, they are soon replaced by new growth. Fleshy roots are easily damaged during transplanting. From spring until autumn, thick pedicels bear umbels of up to 100 large, fragrant flowers with linear white petals that made imaginative people call it Spider Lily. The tubes measure some 7 cm in diameter. Inflorescences appear several times per season and may develop capsules of 5 cm across with globose seeds. All parts are toxic if ingested. If daughter bulbs are not detached, they eventually create an imposing bunch. C. asiaticum tolerates full sun when grown in well-drained, moist soil. Some drought is tolerated by established plants on open ground. In containers, regular irrigation is essential. Potting soil should retain water without getting logged. Watering may be reduced in winter when the plant goes dormant, usually without losing its leaves. Irrigation should be resumed in early spring. Slow-releasing fertiliser should be applied at this time, while potted plants do best with water soluble nutrients every fortnight. In winter, plants may be divided, and new plants may also be achieved by sowing.","description","St. John Lily or Poison Bulb is an evergreen perennial from Southeast Asia.

The crown is broad but not dense. The grey bark is furrowed lengthwise. The dense roots are dominated by a long tap root. The deciduous, alternate leaves are pinnate with three or five oval leaflets. Pale yellow, sweetly scented, small flowers grow on racemes in spring. They develop to pods. In the wild, it is found along riverbanks, but will tolerate drier conditions with several months of drought. Nodules on its wide-spreading roots fix atmospheric nitrogen and gradually improve the soil, but care should be taken not to damage the roots, since suckers may develop. Soils may range from coarse sand to alluvium, with a moderate salinity. Indian Rosewood does not easily compete, especially in terms of light. Before sowing, the seeds should be soaked in water. Root suckers may also serve to grow new plants, but cuttings require additional rooting hormones to thrive. In favourable conditions, the tree grows fast and is rarely infected by pests. The graceful upward branches and light foliage make Dalbergia suitable where filtered sunlight is required, for example on lawns. It is often planted in afforestation schemes and along roads.

If cut into a hedge, care should be taken to provide a slant, so that light reaches the lower branches, keeping them green."

"Riyadh","Duvernoia adhatodoides","description","The Pistol Bush is a shrub of 3 metres in height found in the undergrowth of coastal forests in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. It provides a good background shrub in Arriyadh, preferably in a sheltered environment. It grows an oval or round shape, but may be trained as a standard, revealing a rough, dark-brown bark. Large, evergreen leaves are shiny on top and have a lush impact. Flowering begins in February and may last until August. The conspicuous flowers appear on upright spikes and are white with purple lines. When pollinated by bees they develop into 3  1 cm capsules that burst open with a loud crack to release ripe seeds. This procedure made the Pistol Bush earn its common name. Both the vivid growth and its prolonged flowering period make this shrub a decorative specimen in small gardens and public parks. It may grow as a dense screen, flowering hedge or act as background planting. The large leaves do not take shearing, but pruning is possible at any time of the year. Light frosts are tolerated, but plants should not be exposed to drying winds. Owing to its forest origins, it responds to composted soil and partial sun with healthy growth. It responds well to fertiliser and does best with frequent irrigation in summer. Propagation is possible from both seeds and cuttings. Seedlings often appear in mulch and can be potted to multiply the shrub. It does not become invasive in desert climates, and is generally free of pests and diseases.","description","The Pistol Bush is a shrub of 3 metres in height found in the undergrowth of coastal forests in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.

It is widespread in dry wadi beds in the Arriyadh region, whereby its original climatic zone is more Mediterranean and subtropical. It is known in Arabic as shidq aljamal. The Globe Thistle is a prickly, perennial herb, named after its attractive, spherically shaped, pale-blue flowers. It grows to a height of 60 cm. The stems and leaves are silver grey-green, soft, but with spiny tips and woolly underneath. The plant’s leaves form a star on the ground from which the flower stalk emerges, usually during the early summer, bearing a globe covered with tiny flowers between the spines. The blooms are still attractive, even when dry after flowering. The blue globes attract many butterflies and other insects. The fleshy roots are quite deep. E. hussoni prefers poor, sandy or rocky soil that is well drained. Tolerance to salinity is low, but otherwise the plant is well adapted to harsh, desert conditions. It can be propagated by seed, and it self-seeds easily. An attractive plant for massed planting or groundcover, as well as in rock or steppe gardens, this perennial is very useful for planting in open country as a coloniser, a slope stabiliser or on rocky hillsides. These thistles do not need irrigation once established, and maintenance is also very low.","description","Echinops hussoni, or Globe Thistle, has a wide range of habitats.

Native to Australia, which claims over 500 species of the genus, it has been introduced into many arid countries throughout the world, where they now have the reputation of being invasive, too large and too greedy. Massive with a weeping habit and open crown, it grows very rapidly to a height of 30 metres. Its familiar smooth bark is white and grey, which, when shed in long strips, exposes a red colour underneath. Lanceolate, straight and curved leaves with a fragrant sap are a matt, blue-green; yellowish-white flowers occur in early summer and the seed pods are pea-sized nutlets. E. camaldulensis requires full sun, and although drought tolerant, it will do better with periodic deep watering. It is very tolerant of all soils, even those waterlogged and with a high pH and salinity, but is susceptible to chlorosis. Propagation is by seed. Frost-tolerant, the tree is valuable in giving shade, but it is too huge for garden planting. It plays an important role as a wind break, in reafforestation, stabilising watercourses, and is suitable for roadside planting and parks. E. camaldulensis has a habit of dropping large boughs without warning – a form of self-pruning, but a major problem in urban areas. It is a high-maintenance tree, producing a large amount of leaf, bark and seed litter; its roots are deep, spreading and very aggressive.

The mature leaves are then narrow, curved and dark green, up to 20 cm in length. Cream-coloured flowers produce nectar yielding a typically flavoured honey. The roundish fruits bear many small seeds, shed through the top of the capsule. Like all eucalypts, it has deep-spreading roots and grows rapidly, adapting to the conditions in of all arid regions. E. globulus is the most cultivated plantation tree in Australia, widely used as pulpwood and for fuel. The Blue Gum was often planted as a street tree in the past, but it is now regarded as unsuitable, owing to its mature size and high maintenance requirement. Some ecologists consider it to be an invasive species, as well as a fire hazard. Nevertheless, it is one of several eucalypts suitable for planting in the Arriyadh region as a wind break, in reafforestation, and stabilising slopes and watercourses.

Hardy only to –6C, it produces very dense, durable wood, which is termite-resistant and used for construction purposes. It is also an excellent honey producer. It is easily propagated from seed. Extremely useful as a windbreak and in a shelterbelt, although sensitive to fire, it has high wildlife value. It has been widely planted as a shade-giving tree and roadside tree, but as with other large Eucalyptus trees it is not recommended for this in Arriyadh. It is susceptible to the eucalypt borer and some fungi, especially on dry sites.

"Riyadh","Grevillea robusta","description","The Silk Oak is a strong, enduring tree that reaches a maximum height of 50 metres. However, such growth can be expected only in its native country, Australia. Although it grows quite fast, it will usually not exceed 13 metres, especially in Arriyadh. The tree has a conical, upright form. Fern-like, lacy leaves are shiny green on top and silvery below, while the showy orange flowers are borne in large clusters on the branches, usually when the tree is in a semi-deciduous state after the winter. Silk Oaks are considered evergreen, but foliage may be shed owing to cold, or when the new leaves appear. It will tolerate a wide variety of soils, but these should be well drained. Waterlogging and alkaline desert soils limit the speed of growth and cause iron chlorosis. The wood is brittle and wind exposure may cause branches to die back or break off. Propagation is by seed or cuttings. G. robusta is a background tree for use in parks and in public squares. A mature tree makes a picturesque silhouette against the sky. Heavy pruning is possible, but may spoil the columnar or pyramidal shape. It has toxic qualities. Grevilleas may sometimes cause painful skin irritation. Regular irrigation is necessary at first, but a mature tree is generally drought-resistant and requires a deep soaking every month or so. Heavy leaf litter in spring necessitates a lot of tidying up from lawns and paving, although it can be left as mulch on the soil. This tree is rarely seen in Arriyadh, although it has potential for planting in protected situations.","description","The Silk Oak is a strong, enduring tree that reaches a maximum height of 50 metres.

"Riyadh","Ipomoea pes-caprae","description","From the West Indies, the Beach Morning Glory began to spread, and is now found growing on beaches and dunes in subtropical and tropical climates. It is well established in Arriyadh. It covers the soil sparsely with long stems that root at the nodes to fix itself on the ground. This trait is valued in controlling erosion. Roots may reach 3 metres deep and one plant can cover an area of 30 metres across while being less than 10 cm high. To resist heat and strong winds the evergreen leaves are stiff, almost succulent, and they are lobed like the imprint of a goat’s hoof. Its species’ name, pes-caprae, means foot of a goat. Cold winters may cause it to go dormant and shed its foliage. The funnel-shaped, lilac flowers are very attractive and are borne in late spring until autumn. They measure about 5 cm in diameter and open in the morning, hence their vernacular name Morning Glory. Another common name is Railroad Vine, referring to its very fast growth that occasionally needs to be controlled. Adverse conditions such as high salinity, torrid sun and prolonged drought are tolerated by established plants. Frost will cause dieback and plants often have bare patches where damage has been caused. Although the plant can be grown from seed, it is usually started from cuttings. Beach Morning Glories are ideal plants in low-maintenance gardens with poor soil. Since they do not cover the soil densely, weeds may penetrate the area, so that mulching is required on fertile ground.","description","From the West Indies, the Beach Morning Glory began to spread, and is now found growing on beaches and dunes in subtropical and tropical climates.

The shiny, dark-green foliage is attractive and takes Arriyadh’s climate relatively well in a protected garden environment. The oval leaves may reach 15 cm in length. The Flame of the Woods bears spherical cymes of 12 cm diameter, consisting of scarlet florets. They seem to glow when the shrub is located beneath trees that cast light shade. Types with red, orange and yellow flowers may also be found in cultivation. The peak of floral display is in summer, but inflorescences appear all year round. Flowers are followed by hard berries. Some cultivars remain compact dwarf types, and are therefore ideal plants for containers. The plant tolerates some salinity and brief periods of drought, but performs best in nutritious, well-drained soil which is moist and acidic. Alkaline soil results in iron deficiency, as indicated by yellow leaves. Fertilisers should be applied frequently, especially during the flowering period. It also responds well to compost and manure. Light requirements range from partial shade to full sun. The shrub can be grown as a flowering hedge and takes pruning at any time of the year. It looks best grouped in mixed borders with some shade in the afternoon. Adverse conditions ease infestations by scale insects and nematodes. It may be propagated in summer by softwood cuttings.

In its native environment, this shrub reaches a height of 6 metres, but in Arriyadh it grows to only about half that size. Softwood cuttings root best at the end of summer, encouraged by some rooting hormone. Initially, they should be pinched to achieve regular branching. If grown in pots, the Jungle Flame tends to shed flowers, especially if it is moved. It appreciates light, but does not tolerate full sun if this is associated with harsh conditions such as drought and wind. The soil should be well drained, acidic and nutrient-rich with plenty of compost. Frequent deep irrigation is essential to establish the plants.

"Riyadh","Jacaranda mimosifolia","description","Native to tropical South America, this deciduous tree is an eye-catcher in full flower with large panicles of lilac or pale blue. These appear in spring before the foliage fully forms. Flowers may appear again in autumn, but less obviously, because of the dense bipinnate leaves. They resemble those of some acacias – hence its species’ name mimosifolia – but may immediately be distinguished for their opposite phyllotaxy. Jacaranda comes from the vernacular Brazilian name. They grow fast to a height of about 10 metres and equivalent width in sunny positions when the soil is fertile and frequently watered. The soil should contain compost and be fast-draining. Unfavourable conditions such as compacted soil or continual drought will lead to dead branches. The shallow-growing roots must not be damaged. Jacaranda is not often seen in Arriyadh; it is not particularly well suited to the climate and its growth often comes to a standstill. In Arriyadh’s coldest regions, the Jacaranda’s twigs may freeze, but trees soon recover just as if they had been pruned. The tree can be cut back in late winter. Large, flat, red-brown fruits somehow resemble ravioli and reveal seeds that easily germinate if watered for 24 hours before sowing. Jacarandas may be grown in pots for their attractive fern-like leaves, but flowers will not appear on such plants. Mature trees are flat-topped and their lacy foliage creates light summer shade. With summer humidity, they make specimens for pedestrian areas.

This is a popular shrub in Arriyadh, which somehow never looks its best. The evergreen leaves are leathery, glossy and grouped in twos or threes along the twining stems. They differ from those of other species by being entire. In summer, clusters of white, tubular flowers are borne to emit the outstanding fragrance that jasmines are known for. In other seasons, flowering is sporadic. Full or partial sun is required to produce abundant inflorescences. A fertile, well-drained soil allows vital growth so that this climber will stand some drought when established. However, it appreciates frequent irrigation and generally remains free from pests and diseases. General purpose fertilisers should be applied in two split doses during spring to support new growth first and development of flower buds later on. Transplanting is best done in autumn. Low temperatures are no problem, but Arabian Jasmines should not be exposed to prolonged frosts. They need to be trained along a support such as a trellis or a pergola reaching about 3 metres in height. Plants will also grow in containers and tolerate pruning at any time to form a shrub, for instance, but not a climber. It may also blanket the ground with its attractive dark-green foliage. Cuttings and sowing are handy methods of propagation.

Clusters of small tubular flowers show up in the colours white, yellow, orange, red, pink or purple. They appear in winter for weeks. The Flaming Katy may grow as a tough indoor plant or as a highly ornamental bedding plant. The soil should be well drained.

This starts from the bottom progressing upwards, until the branches bear remnants of foliage that will not become attractive again. Cutting back may result in rejuvenating growth, but it is more appropriate to replace the entire planting. After flowering, the flower stalks should be cut off to give a neat appearance and to induce the production of new buds. A disadvantage is the brittle leaves and branches. They are easily damaged, which means that the Flaming Katy should be located carefully. In Arriyadh’s climate, it does best if not exposed to full sun, especially in the afternoon.

One of its most attractive attributes is the attractive, smooth grey/brown trunk and branch structure, appearing to be polished in winter, the bark of which peels off to reveal a pinkish inner bark. The tree requires sun and heat to bloom well, with some wind protection and though quite drought resistant, regular irrigation and deep watering in summer are appreciated. The Crape Myrtle prefers well-drained, fertile, sandy soils, but is not tolerant of alkaline or saline soil. It will tolerate frost in Riyadh. Propagation is usually by seed. A slow release fertilizer, rich in nitrogen and potassium, can be applied 2 to 3 times per year. Susceptible to mildew and attacks by aphids and cochineals, systemic fungicides and insecticides will prevent these, when applied in spring. Prone also to leaf burn and chlorosis, due to irrigation with saline and alkaline water, the soil must be leached and treated with iron. Requiring only low maintenance and light pruning to encourage flowering, this tree is excellent on patios, in containers, and close to doorways.","description","Native to China, the Crape Myrtle is a beautiful, tall shrub or small tree growing up to 5 m high and wide, which makes a lovely accent in a garden.

"Riyadh","Lampranthus aureus","description","This sturdy plant originates from the Western Cape region, South Africa. Gold Ice Plants are small shrubs with succulent leaves arranged in pairs. In ideal conditions, they can grow up to 50 cm high, but they usually form low mats of some 15 cm. The foliage is dark green, but turns pale bluish-green in drought and may reach 5 cm in length. During its flowering period, the entire plant is covered with bright-orange, daisy-like flowers borne in stalked clusters or single, each measuring some 5 cm across. They close at night and will not open unless bright sunlight induces them to do so. Accordingly, they are also known as Midday Plants or Municipal Workers, because the inflorescences open at 9 in the morning and close at 5 in the afternoon. Flowers appear from late spring until early autumn, after pollination by insects, they are followed by capsules. An adaptation to desert conditions is a mechanism that seeds are not released from the capsules before it rains, even if this takes several months. Seeds are produced in abundance and are an easy method for multiplying the plants. Another method of propagation is to take cuttings in autumn. The plant grows well in sand or loam, but does not tolerate waterlogging. By virtue of the leaves’ capacity to store water, established plants do well with little supplemental irrigation. Watering may be done with medium levels of salt. Gold Ice Plants are suitable for large groundcover areas and containers. In Arriyadh, they withstand the harsh conditions of hot sun and winter cold very well.","description","This sturdy plant originates from the Western Cape region, South Africa.

"Riyadh","Lampranthus glaucus","description","The Yellow Vygie is one of more than 220 species of this genus, which makes it the largest group within the ice plant family (Aizoaceae). Glaucus is the Greek word for blue, and refers to the colour of the three-angled leaves that protect this perennial from glaring sun. The plant grows fairly quickly to build a dense cushion up to 60 cm in height, but usually much lower, forming mats of some 20 cm. Large, sulphur-yellow flowers cover the plant in spring. If pollinated by insects, the flowers develop into woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It grows in full sun to partial shade, tolerates heat but also survives frosts up to –10C. Tolerating a considerable period of drought makes the Yellow Vygie interesting for xeriscape (water-wise) uses. Frequent watering is appreciated, but the plant may quickly be overwatered in heavy soils. Propagation is simple by cuttings, but the surface must callous before planting. The plants also grow well from seeds. Capsules swell up after sufficient rain only to release seeds when there is a sufficient amount of water to ensure successful germination. This robust plant gives a showy display without much effort. It is an ideal groundcover or group plant for low-maintenance gardens, parks and in containers. Infestations are rare, but weak plants may be attacked by scale, which requires treatment with a systemic pesticide. Some compost is welcome, although the plants are used to poor and alkaline soil conditions.","description","The Yellow Vygie is one of more than 220 species of this genus, which makes it the largest group within the ice plant family (Aizoaceae).

L. camara is the garden relative of Lantana horrida, which is much more drought-tolerant, but even less frost-tolerant. Lantanas are best propagated by cuttings. They are versatile shrubs for arid regions forming natural screens, clipped hedges or splashes of colour. It is a popular shrub in urban areas, public open spaces and park planting. It is useful as low underplanting and in extensive landscapes; it will almost become naturalised. It is now quite wild in certain areas of the Diplomatic Quarter. Relatively low maintenance is required, and a dense, attractive shape is achieved by regular pruning.

Usually best in full sun, it will also tolerate shade in Arriyadh. Soils should be fertile and moist as well as well drained. Plants require abundant water, but should not be waterlogged in winter. Propagation is by seeds, which are poisonous. Generally pest-free, plants may suffer from stem and root rot. Lobelia is a well-known garden plant, grown for its long flowering period. In Arriyadh, it will survive mild frosts and continue flowering after its planting in late autumn until the heat of early summer, when it will begin to burn. L. erinus is normally used as an edging plant or groundcover; there are also trailing or cascading varieties, which are suitable for baskets, containers and the tops of walls. Apart from weeding, it requires little maintenance after being planted out.","description","Originating in South Africa, Lobelia is a herbaceous perennial, usually grown as an annual bedding plant and widely planted across the globe for summer colour.

Native to India, Myanmar and Malaysia, this slow-growing, long-lived tree will not reach these proportions in Arriyadh, but it can still make an attractive, fruit-bearing tree when well cultivated and protected from frost. Nearly evergreen, alternate leaves, up to 30 cm long and 5 cm wide, are borne in rosettes at the tips of the branches; new leaves are yellowish to wine-red. Hundreds of small, yellowish flowers are borne in spring in large clusters. The fruits, varying in form, size, colour and quality depending on the variety, contain a single, flattened, pale, hard stone. Preferring rich, deep, well-drained soil, but not too particular with regard to soil type, the tap root may descend to a depth of 6 metres. It performs well in sand, gravel and on limestone. Mango trees grow readily from seed and require high nitrogen fertilisation in the early years. Drought tolerance is low and regular irrigation is required. Usually no pruning is done at first and then only to improve the form. The Mango has a great many predators: some secrete honeydew, giving rise to sooty mould on leaves. One serious disease is powdery mildew, controllable by regular spraying. Nutrient deficiency is indicated by paleness, distortion and limpness of foliage. Lack of iron produces chlorosis in young trees. Mangos are good as specimen shade trees in Arriyadh, but require high maintenance.","description","The unmistakable Mango Tree is a huge tree when mature, reaching a height of 30 metres with a broad, and rounded canopy of the same width.

Melia azederach is a deciduous tree that reaches a height of between 6 and 17 metres with a spread of up to 12 metres. Azederach comes from the Persian ‘azad dirakht’, and means ‘the gorgeous tree’. It originates from southwest Asia and western China. It has a broad open crown and often develops multi-branches. The fresh-green leaves are arranged alternately, with an ovate form and dentate margins. The lilac, violet and whitish-yellow flowers appear in spring, in panicles up to 25 cm long. The single flowers are about 1.5 cm in size. The tree flowers after three or four years for the first time. After flowering, the tree develops attractive round yellow berries, each about 1 cm in size. Prayer beads were once made from the seeds. Occasional pruning of the tree is recommended. Propagation can be done by seed and in good conditions by self-seeding and by runners. The Bead Tree normally grows in regions with an annual rainfall of between 600 and 1,000 mm. Accordingly, the tree responds well to air humidity and regular irrigation. It can also withstand medium salinity. As a younger tree, it may suffer from winter frost. In Arriyadh, it can be found in the Diplomatic Quarter in the inner Tuwaiq Palace garden.

The flowers appear in summer as pink spikes. Mentha loves a sunny location, but with good irrigated soil. For a favoured location, it can be used as grouped plantation or groundcover at pond edges or in swamps. With sun, the aromatic oils in the plant will be optimally developed. The leaves can be used for fresh mint tea, even when dry. In Arab countries, peppermint tea is served after dinner because of its good digestive properties, in addition to the refreshing taste. It has an anti-bacterial function; the aromatic oil helps with headaches and can be inhaled to alleviate colds. Mentha is not suitable for babies, because the oil is too strong. Propagation can be done by runners and cuttings which root easily. Sometimes, if the location meets the plant’s requirements, Mentha can be invasive, but can be easily controlled by reducing the water supply. Pruning from time to time, and at the beginning of a new season, will support the dense growth.

It grows to a height and spread of between 6 and 15 metres. The crown has a round regular shape. The leaves are dark green and cottony (pubescent) underneath. They are arranged alternately, with an ovate form and serrate margins. The flower is inconspicuous, but the fruit appears raspberry-like in a black purple egg-shaped berry. The fruit sap is very intense in colour, a consideration for their use next to footpaths, because of possible stains on the paving. Fruitless varieties are therefore more suitable in landscape design. The fruit is edible. The Mulberry likes penetrable, limey soils. The tree is propagated by seeds. Morus can withstand urban microclimates, but is vulnerable to desiccation. It therefore needs good irrigation with low salinity. Because of its requirements, the Black Mulberry is advisable for more sheltered situations, where microclimates provide air humidity, such as lawned areas. Morus can suffer from frost, and shelter against frost damage is advisable for young trees. Its use in urban design can be seen in public open space and park plantations, as well as in private parks.

"Riyadh","Opuntia ficus-indica","description","Although its species name means ‘Indian Fig’, this cactus is much better known as Prickly Pear, or sabbar in Arabic. It may grow like a shrub. It consists of paddle-shaped segments which eventually become round, forming a solid branch. Both trunk and branches do not build solid wood, but rather a spongy tissue which is robust enough to bear the heavy, fleshy crown. Its origin is allegedly Mexico. It is one of the few New World cacti growing in Saudi Arabia, and is often seen on farms in Arriyadh. In spring, beautiful, bright-yellow flowers appear at the upper edges of the segments. After fertilisation by numerous kinds of insects, the base becomes swollen to develop into a delicious-tasting, egg-shaped fruit. Green at first, this turns yellow, orange and finally deep purple when fully ripe. The segments may or may not feature the thorns that so many cacti are known for. Thorny varieties are set around fields as a living fence, while bare cultivars are grown for their fruit as hedges or specimens. They are often planted ornamentally as an impenetrable ground cover. All Prickly Pear fruits are armed with tiny, apparently harmless areoles that bear bristly glochids. These penetrate human skin instantly causing a nasty itching for hours or days, since they are difficult to remove. Segments easily root if buried to one third in well-drained soil. Apart from the water permeability, the soil can have any properties; and it can have some salinity. There are no problems with heat, or full or even reflected sun.","description","Although its species name means ‘Indian Fig’, this cactus is much better known as Prickly Pear, or sabbar in Arabic.

It grows in full sun, thrives with moderate watering, but takes some drought; most types of soil are acceptable, and the plant is wind-resistant. Pests and diseases are rare, which means this South African plant is ideal for low-maintenance uses. Too much fertiliser results in leggy, tender stems that grow criss-cross while extreme heat in Arriyadh can cause the plant’s growth to stagnate. The foliage is spoon-shaped, bright green and some 5 cm in length. In blossom for most of the year, it is topped by scores of spectacular daisy flowers some 8 cm across. The outer ring is either white or lavender with a violet centre of fertile inflorescences. Spent flowers may be discarded to encourage the development of new buds. The plant grows 20 to 30 cm high, but spreads readily by creeping stems that become rooted wherever they touch soil. It is therefore very easy to propagate by cuttings or separating layers. African Daisies look well cascading over edges, in containers or in beddings. They suit rock gardens and like border planting alike, and since they need little attention they may be grown in both private gardens and public parks. In colder climates, they are grown annually or as pot plants, since they flower abundantly even when young. Despite its vigorous growth the plant does not escape from its designated site. In the immediate neighbourhood, slow-growing perennials or small shrubs that could be overgrown should be avoided.","description","The African Daisy is a fast-growing groundcover for large open spaces and on slopes.

The bright yellow, daisy-like flowers are 2 cm in diameter, on long, thin stems above the foliage, as if they were floating above the shrub, which they cover in spring. The Brittlebush is completely adapted to desert conditions. Fast growing, especially after a wet winter, it needs nearly no irrigation once established. It will, however, die out after some years when very dry, only to make a comeback after self-seeding. It is tolerant of neither high salinity nor light frost, after which it will recover in spring. Encelia prefers full sun or partially sunny locations, and sandy or rocky soil with good drainage. Propagation can be done by seed or with cuttings. If self-seeding is not required, pruning of florescence after flowering is advisable, and trimming of branches in autumn will encourage dense growth. Attractive planting schemes with bright spots of colour can be created with E. farinosa as a small hedge, in grouped or massed planting in public open spaces and urban areas, as well as in park or street median planting and in pedestrian precincts and containers.

Propagation is from scarified seed, pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard coating. Widely planted as an ornamental, on account of its profusion of flowers, it is a popular garden or feature plant that attracts wildlife. In Australia, trees regenerate freely after fires, which, although killing the plants, help the germination of seed stored in the soil, if rain occurs soon after.

This species has few branches and rarely flowers: it produces rosettes of arching, linear, spiny yellow leaves, up to 1 metre long, with green margins, when mature. Male and female flowers lack petals and are borne on separate plants. Female flowers resemble small, red-coloured pineapples when fertilised. The Screw Pine has a high drought tolerance, but grows well in moist, sandy, clayey, alkaline soils, even with high salinity. It does best with regular irrigation, minimal in winter, and fertilising monthly from spring to summer. It is a very adaptable plant, although it prefers hot, dry conditions; propagation is by cuttings, which root readily when placed directly in the soil. It is occasionally infested by scale insects. Amongst the uses of Pandanus are the leaves used for weaving material for clothes, dyes collected from the roots and treatment of inflammation.

Date Palms are naturally wind-pollinated, but on farms they are manually pollinated by skilled labourers; a male tree produces enough pollen to pollinate up to 50 female trees. When pollinated, female trees produce large pendulous clusters of cylindrical orange to brown fruits, which stand out from the base of the fronds. Dates when unripe, they range from red to bright yellow in colour. The Date Palm requires full sun, but will tolerate shade. Trees are frost-resistant. Being drought-tolerant, regular irrigation is necessary for good fruits, and the plants appreciate deep watering in summer. In winter, a tree will need only half of the summer irrigation rate. The tree prefers well-drained, deep, sandy loams and tolerates salinity. It is best planted in late spring or summer. Date Palms require good and regular fertilising. Tree hole lancing with a mixture of sand and fertiliser in spring is also very effective. Propagation is by seed or best from suckers. Date Palms are affected by many pests, which attack the trunk and growing points. The most dangerous is the Red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus), which is difficult to detect in the early stages of infestation. The initial signs are holes and the oozing of a brown viscous liquid on the trunk or in the crown. Eventually, the entire crown of the tree will wither and begin to fall off. This is now a worldwide problem. Weak or transplanted large specimens seem to be the main victims. Other pests are leaf skeletonisers and scale insects. Date palms require intensive maintenance and cultivation. Date Palms are easily transplanted to new locations and there are specific procedures for this. The Date Palm is a magnificent, all-round tree, spectacular in culture on farms, and it lends itself splendidly to landscape design in Arriyadh. It makes a beautiful, almost ceremonial roadside tree. Seen on a skyline, it produces an oasis effect. Too large for most small gardens, it is an excellent park tree, as a specimen or background planting or for shade on pathways.

"Riyadh","Phoenix roebelenii","description","The Pygmy Date Palm, native to southeast Asia, is one of the most commonly used kinds of dwarf palms. In Arriyadh, it is suitable for small gardens and courtyards, but needs some shade from the sun. A very long-lived, slow-growing slender tree up to 3 metres tall, this palm likes partial shade to full sun; morning sun is recommended. It has a dense crown of leaves that are 60–120 cm long, and pinnate with some 100 leaflets. Each leaflet is 15–25 cm long and 1 cm across, slightly drooping, and bright green in colour with scurfy pubescence below; the thorns at the base of the frond are very sharp. The flowers are small and yellowish: the fruit is a 1-cm drupe, resembling a small, thin-fleshed date. In nature, the trees are usually single-trunked, in cultivation multiple trunks are often produced. Very frost-tolerant for short periods of time, they are also drought- and saltwater-tolerant. They like a fertile, well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels and respond well to regular applications of fertiliser. The trees adapt to most soils and tolerate waterlogging, clay, loam or sandy soils, low in nutrients. Regular irrigation is required. Propagation is by seed or division. The Pygmy Date Palm is generally pest- and disease-free. It requires little pruning to develop a strong structure; old and dead fronds should be trimmed below the spines. Graceful in appearance, P. roebelenii is a popular ornamental plant which looks well by poolsides, on patios, in shopping malls and office entrances, and is a perfect container plant.","description","The Pygmy Date Palm, native to southeast Asia, is one of the most commonly used kinds of dwarf palms.

Phragmites is a perennial grass which is both heat- and frost-tolerant. It grows to a height of between 90 cm and 2.5 metres. It is a fast-growing grass with strong rhizomes. It can be invasive in situations where all conditions are optimal for its development. It can also withstand high salinity. The flowers appear as impressive florets between 20 and 35 cm in size. The spike has a violet-magenta colour. The inflorescence appears in early September and remains on the plant for a long time, keeping the grass attractive throughout the winter. Reed Grass grows close to water edges, on shorelines. Phragmites is well known in the Wadi Hanifah and the Al Hair Lakes. Because it is such a strong plant, its use is not advisable for small ponds. For natural water features such as the Al Hair Lakes, however, it is a valuable plant species because of its water-cleansing properties. It helps to maintain the natural water ecosystem in equilibrium. Reed Grass is a phytoremediation or water-treatment plant, and provides a habitat for many different varieties of wildlife. Accordingly, Phragmites is a useful plant for bank stabilisation, open country and environmental consolidation. It can also be used as screen. It becomes a dominant plant very quickly. Recommended propagation measures are by runners, division and direct sowing.

The Latin name auriculata refers to the ear-shaped leaf base, and Plumbago includes the Latin word for lead because it allegedly healed lead poisoning. Flowers may appear for a very long time, but between June and September the Cape Leadwort is coated in sky blue. ‘Alba’ is a white-flowering cultivar and ‘Royal Cape’ has intensely blue flowers. The campanulate inflorescences attract butterflies. Following pollination, seed capsules, develop retaining their adhesion to allow distribution by passing animals. In its natural habitat, this climber is associated with the Cape Honeysuckle (Tecomaria capensis). It may be trained to cover a fence, or grow against a wall or along a trellis. It takes hard pruning and will even flower within the same year. Its limited size means that it can climb into trees without suffocating them. An interesting feature is the suckers that may allow the Cape Leadwort to grow as a large-scale areal cover. It resists drought, and thrives in any type of soil. However, additional watering and high levels of humus and nutrients are welcome. Frost may cause foliage and slender twigs to die back, but plants quickly recover.

The leaves are arranged oppositely, and their form is entire and lanceolate. The flowers and fruits are often found together on one plant. Flowering begins in spring. The bloom is a calyx in deep-orange to bright-red. The ripe fruit is bright red. It is apple-shaped and round. The fruit contains granate, red, pearl-like juicy pits which are edible and very healthy. Maintenance requirements are moderate, because the shrub is slow growing; pruning is not often required. Punica granatum has no major soil requirements. Irrigation should be medium and the salinity content not higher than medium. The air-humidity should be sufficient. The plant otherwise loves a sunny location and it is heat-resistant. Propagation is by sowing and pricking. Pomegranates are highly attractive as specimens and as grouped plants, together with plenty of potential for linear planting and hedges. This bee-attracting plant is useful for screens, in public open spaces, as park planting, in pedestrian precincts and in private parks. The possible fruit drop should be taken into account when grown next to pathways.","description","The common name of this medium-sized shrub is Pomegranate, or rumman in Arabic.

"Riyadh","Quisqualis indica","description","Rangoon Creeper grows wild in southeast Asia from Myanmar (Burma) to the Philippines, and is often seen as an ornamental climber in Arriyadh. It may become naturalised in humid climates, forming thickets in secondary forests, but will not invade intact ecosystems. The generic name is the Latin question What is that?, while the specific name describes its origin from tropical Asia. This ligneous vine may quickly reach a height of 8 metres. It is cultivated for attractive, fragrant flowers that open pale pink, turning to intense red while blooming. In open clusters, the star-like flowers are arranged on slender, long funnels appearing mainly in summer. They develop into winged, black fruits some 3 cm in size. The leaves are up to 15 cm long, and arranged oppositely along the woody twigs. Light frosts are not harmful, while the shrub recovers in spring if it has died back or following hard pruning. Planting locations should be in full sun to partial shade. Some drought is tolerated in nutrient-rich soils that should be well drained. The ground should not be compacted, and can range from acidic to alkaline. Being resistant to urban microclimates and limited in size, Quisqualis makes an ideal low-maintenance vine in Arriyadh. It is grown widely in private gardens and public parks for its attractive, scented flowers. Kept under control by clipping, it also performs well in containers. Double flowers are born on a cultivar named ‘Thai Hybrid’.","description","Rangoon Creeper grows wild in southeast Asia from Myanmar (Burma) to the Philippines, and is often seen as an ornamental climber in Arriyadh.

A number of different varieties have been cultivated for hundreds of years in China, so it is not easy to recognise the differences between wild roses and the cultivars. The cultivars appear in a very wide range of colours when they flower. The rose is a beautiful ornamental plant. Roses bloom in early summer, and release a strong fruity scent. The China Rose flowers repetitively, and is referred to as remontant. It came to Europe in the late eighteenth century, and about 200 different cultivars were bred with filled blossom. For the most part, their colours were red and pink, but not yellow. Roses prefer a sunny location with ample irrigation and nutrients. Pruning is required after flowering. In landscape design, roses are suitable for planting in sheltered locations such as parks, private gardens and as a container plant. In Arriyadh, they can be seen in several private parks and gardens. But even outside of Arriyadh, this rose is sufficiently hardy, for example, in sheltered court yards.

With a rapid growth rate, this dense and vigorous, vine-like shrub forms green highly pliable stems up to 6 metres long. It has glossy, leathery leaves 5 to 10 cm long with seven leaflets, and rich, long-lasting, inflorescences composed of fragrant, apple-scented panicles of small, white flowers with five petals and prominent yellow stamens. These are followed by dark-red, rose-hip fruits. This rose will grow in most fertile, well-drained garden soils in full sun, and is very frost hardy. Slightly drought-tolerant, the rose benefits from deep watering every three to four weeks in summer. Fertilising should be done at the beginning of the growing season, with mature manure around the base of the rose canes every two to three years. They require pre-emptive treatment with insecticide and systemic fungicide to prevent attack by aphids and the development of fungal diseases. Rambling roses require more than a trellis for support. They are excellent on the side of a building, fence or shade structure, but require securing on stakes and strong fastening to structures. They will also grow into the branches of a tree when planted close together, which means that a non-blooming tree appears to bear flowers. This a plant with high maintenance requirements, best suited to a plant enthusiast’s private garden.","description","This form of wild rose, first collected in its native Japan, has several cultivars which are commonly grown as rambling roses, suitable for planting as climbers in the protected garden in Arriyadh.

It is not related to the pepper plant (Piper nigrum), but the edible, red fruits are similar to pepper corns and the tree is so called, because of their shape and taste. In fact, all parts of the tree are rich in essential oils. The evergreen to semi-evergreen tree grows to a height of 15 meters. It has an open, umbrella shaped crown with pendulous branches.

"Riyadh","Schinus terebinthifolius","description","Schinus terebinthifolius is the Brazilian Pepper Tree, and like its relative is also known in Arabic as filfil-arid. It comes originally from Brazil. It prefers humid, tropical to Mediterranean climatic zones, and is relatively successful in Arriyadh, probably more so than S. molle. The tree reaches a height of 9 metres, with a similar width. It has an open, umbrella-shaped crown. The foliage is evergreen. The leaves are alternate, imparipinnate, entire and lanceolate to ovate in shape. The small white flowers appear in panicles; from these flowers, the tree develops the typical rose-pepper fruits. Propagation can be done by sowing and cuttings. The Brazilian Pepper requires full sun, but some humidity in Arriyadh, regular irrigation and has medium tolerance to salinity, thriving on most soils with good drainage. It is, however, not absolutely hardy. It can withstand temperatures down to 5C, but is susceptible to cool, dry winds on the outskirts of Arriyadh. The Brazilian Pepper is a good ornamental tree in frost-free regions, thanks to its lush green foliage and fruits. In Arriyadh, sheltered locations should be selected for landscape planting. It can be used in public open spaces, park planting and in pedestrian precincts. Maintenance is minimal: consideration should be given to the possible litter from fruit drop, wind damage and the tree’s invasive root system. With its dense foliage canopy, it can also be recommended as a shade tree along pathways or as a small tree for a patio or garden and a slope stabiliser.","description","Schinus terebinthifolius is the Brazilian Pepper Tree, and like its relative is also known in Arabic as filfil-arid.

"Riyadh","Tradescantia pallida","description","Known as Purple Heart or Purple Queen, this herbaceous plant is widely distributed for its colourful qualities. The species is indigenous to eastern Mexico, where its green foliage is flushed with red for protection in full sun. In cultivation, a variety named ‘Purpurea’ is usually found, with dull foliage in deep purple when it is grown in full sun. Less light is accepted, but the colour will fade to greenish-red. The plant blankets open areas with fleshy stems that root at the nodes to form a dense mat between 10 cm and 15 cm high, and somewhat higher where it can lean on walls or neighbouring plants. Its width is permanently spread when the twigs touch the ground for rooting. The leaves measure between 8 cm and 12 cm in length. In summer, small pink flowers are borne at the tips, which are pointed upwards. They look attractive, but do not appear in abundance. After flowering, the shoots may be pinched to encourage denser growth. In Arriyadh, the foliage is evergreen unless the site is exposed to frosts. However, plants recover from dying back when weather turns warmer in spring. In adverse conditions, the plant may also be grown in pots or containers, and makes an ideal plant in hanging baskets. It is very easy to multiply by cuttings, either in water or in compost, but it should be borne in mind that the sap may cause irritation to sensitive skin. Purple Hearts perform best in well-drained, fertile soil with frequent watering. On the other hand, they are widely adaptable, tolerating poor soil, some drought and even neglect.","description","Known as Purple Heart or Purple Queen, this herbaceous plant is widely distributed for its colourful qualities.

In Arriyadh, it has proved to be excellent for planting under trees, because it tolerates shade and remains lush green during winter. The grass stolons or runners form a dense mat of leaves and flattened stems up to 20 cm high with erect, branching culms up to 50 cm; the leaves are stiff with broad, flat blades rounded at the tips. S. secundatum grows in well or poorly drained soils, from sandy loams to light clays; its habitat is on calcareous sands near the sea. Able to survive with low fertility, it requires lawn fertilising to look good. It is tolerant of soil salinity and is moderately drought-tolerant, though prefers regular irrigation. It is more tolerant of cold and frost than many tropical grasses; it is available in varieties bred for their shade and cold tolerance as well as resistance to pests and diseases: e.g. Captiva (R), Sapphire and Seville. Typically propagated by plugs, sprigs or turf, seed is now available commercially. St Augustine is excellent for private garden lawns in Arriyadh, although it is less drought-tolerant than Bermuda grass. S. secundatum is prone to a range of nematodes and fungal diseases such as brown patch, grey leaf spot, and St. Augustine Decline caused by a mosaic virus. A low- to medium-maintenance grass, it keeps down most weeds and other grasses. Extremely tolerant of mowing, it makes a good ground cover for soil conservation and sand stabilisation.","description","St. Augustine Grass or Buffalo Grass, originating in South Africa, is popularly used for lawns in tropical and subtropical regions.

Fertile soils with good drainage meet its requirements, together with frequent irrigation and moderate to high amounts of fertiliser. It takes some salinity and alkaline soils, but does best with high levels of humus and some acidic ground. Once established, it takes brief periods of drought. For the sake of its sculptural appearance, this plant deserves a focal location. It also forms a dense screen.

The bush is about 1.5 metres high, but from autumn to spring imposing flowers stand above the leaves. A horizontal spathe resembles a bird’s head. Flowers are raised one by one from this sheath, consisting of three orange sepals and three dark-blue petals each. Pollination is by birds. Strelitzias do not have many particular site requirements. With frequent irrigation, the plants thrive in full sun, but also produce flowers in partial shade. A rich soil with loam and compost is the most suitable, and occasional fertilising guarantees vital growth of healthy leaves and flowers. Hailing from coastal regions, they tolerate some salinity in the water applied, and withstand strong winds without damage. Low temperatures are tolerated as long as there are no frosts. They make a strong accent in sheltered gardens in Arriyadh. Bird of Paradise plants flourish in containers and look well as accent plants, either singly or grouped. The spectacular flowers should be accessible to enable pedestrians to take a closer look. Sowing in spring may result in flowering offspring within three to five years.

This species, which can be found throughout Saudi Arabia, reaches a height of between 6 and 15 metres. It is a fast-growing tree, sometimes confused with Casuarina equisetifolia, since both are planted on farms in the Arriyadh region as a windbreak and to demarcate fields. Its shape is often irregular, multi-stemmed and crooked. The foliage is deciduous, and from green to light grey in colour. The leaves are imbricate, entire and squamate. The pale-yellow to pale-pink flowers appear in spring. The single flower is small, but together in long racemes the flowers stand out on the branches. The fruits are small capsules with 0.5-mm seeds. Propagation is best by seed, suckers and cuttings. Tamarix aphylla has a deep, extensive root system. It grows in any soil, especially salt marshes and sandy or silty soil. This tree is highly salt-tolerant, itself exuding salt, which accumulates in crusted layers on the foliage and drips onto the ground around the tree.

"Riyadh","Thevetia peruviana","description","At first sight this shrub is often mistaken for an oleander, which is its most popular relative. Indigenous to tropical America this plant became known as Yellow Oleander to all frost-free regions worldwide. In late spring until autumn it grows funnel-shaped, fragrant flowers in yellow, salmon or orange about 5 to 8 cm in size. Inflorescences attract butterflies and scattered blooming occurs the rest of the year. A variety called ‘Alba’ shows white flowers that contrast well to the lush green foliage. The leaves are lanceolate and often pendulous with a glossy surface measuring about 15 cm in length. Odd-shaped, bulky pods are green at first to turn red and black when ripe. They grow two nut-like seeds which readily germinate. The other method of propagation is semi-mature cuttings planted in late summer. For best appearance the soil should be well-drained and fertile with frequent irrigation. Nevertheless it takes full sun, heat, salinity and even drought. In cultivation Yellow Oleanders remain shrubs some 3 m high while they may grow as small trees to 6 m in their homeland or under ideal conditions. In some regions it is considered invasive. A very common and useful shrub in Riyadh it is easy to grow and always has a lush appearance. They can be planted in containers, as flowering hedge or trained as a specimen tree. Heavy pruning is taken and results in rejuvenated, lush growth. Wounds exude milky latex that irritates the skin. The entire plants contains toxic substances that might be used medically to cure toothache or as a purgative.","description","At first sight this shrub is often mistaken for an oleander, which is its most popular relative.

"Riyadh","Verbena tenuisecta","description","A wide range of Vervains are grown seasonally for their colourful floral display. This Moss Vervain is a ground-hugging perennial from tropical and subtropical south America with finely dissected, evergreen foliage and terminal clusters of tubular flowers. In spring, the flowers appear in hues of white, lilac, purple and violet, and in Arriyadh they often re-bloom after summer when temperatures fall. The flowers are heavily visited by butterflies. The plants thrive in fertile soils that drain well, either exposed to full sun or with some shade. With lack of light, they grow less dense, forming some upright shoots up to about 15 cm. They make excellent groundcovers to accompany roses, or for spilling over edges. In open ground, they take heat if watered frequently, and appropriate irrigation is also required to thrive in containers. The mossy covers are attractive on slopes where they contrast with boulders and upright plants. Usually fast-growing plants, they respond to ongoing drought with stagnant growth, burnt leaf edges or loss of the plants altogether. Moss Vervains do not tolerate frost, but low temperatures are accepted, sometimes leading to reddish foliage without damage. Propagation is done commercially by sowing, but is also possible by cuttings or division, since the stems root where they touch the ground. Since the plants are rarely infested by pests and diseases, maintenance is limited to weeding until the plants become established. Fertiliser is best applied by slow-releasing granules in the spring and autumn.","description","A wide range of Vervains are grown seasonally for their colourful floral display.

Vitis is indigenous to the Mediterranean region, central Europe and southwest Asia as far as Iran. Vitis is a climbing plant or liana which can develop vines up to 35 metres long. The leaves are alternate, palmate and lobed. The flowers are unimpressive in panicles, and greenish-yellow in colour; it is from these that the berries known as grapes develop. Vitis grows as a native in riparian forests, plains or hill country. The soil needs to be rich in humus, from dry to moderately moist. Irrigation should be moderate, with low salinity. Vitis appreciates a sunny location. In Arriyadh, it is often seen on farms growing on wooden frames. It should not be too exposed to intense sun. Certain sheltered locations on the wall of a building or a gazebo, where it needs some framework for climbing in partial shade, will be excellent for Vitis. Pruning is required frequently to optimise the growth and to train the plant. The fruits are sour or sweet, depending on the sun and degree of ripeness. The plant attracts birds and bees.

The Desert Fan Palm is indigenous to northwest Mexico, western Arizona and California, where it reaches 25 metres height in favourable conditions. In cultivation, it may not exceed a height of 15 metres, but in any case the width ranges from 3 to 5 metres. It is a very successful fan palm in Arriyadh. Its large leaves consist of a strong petiole that is armed with sharp hooks along the edges, and a round blade which is folded many times in section. Often, they are divided in sections exposing fibres in between. Additionally, the tips are brushy and refer to the species’ name filifera, which means ‘ wearing filaments’. Young leaves always emerge from the crown’s terminus, unfold and slowly bend down when mature to eventually persist when dry to form an ornamental skirt which led to its other common name, Petticoat Palm. White flowers appear on stalks that are often several metres long. When pollinated, they turn into dark-brown, oval fruit. This species develops a much wider trunk than its relative, Washingtonia robusta. Hybrids may occur both in the wild and in cultivation. Desert Fan Palms take all types of well-drained soils, even alkaline and poor conditions. Overwatering may result in rotting which kills the plant. Frost and drought are tolerated, and the palm thrives in both full sun and semi-shade locations alike. Growth can be accelerated by frequent watering and all-purpose fertilisers.","description","This palm is grown in all frost-free climates for its tough nature and pretty appearance.

"Riyadh","Ziziphus jujuba","description","Ziziphus jujuba is known by its common names of Chinese Date, Red Date and Chinese Jujube. It is native to central China, the eastern Himalayas and Japan. It originally grew in the hills or mountains at an altitude of 1,700 metres, in dry and sunny locations. The shrub or tree reaches a height of 10 metres and a width of 6 metres. The tree has a normal growth rate and often develops multiple stems. The deciduous foliage is green; the leaves are alternately arranged, entire and ovate in shape. The inconspicuous flowers, which appear in spring, are small, 5 mm in size, and whitish-yellow. Later, the tree produces edible fruits 3 cm across, with an apple taste. With increasing ripeness, the fruits turn brownish. The seed is a small stone, like that of an olive. The Chinese Date is best propagated by sowing and pricking. The tree is thorny and has an extensive, deep root system. It otherwise has low soil and irrigation requirements, and can withstand high salinity. No maintenance is required, other than periodic pruning. This Ziziphus can be found in Arriyadh on some private farms, because of its delicious fruits. It is not as hardy and adapted to desert climates as some native species, but the fruit itself and the crop are larger. This tree can be recommended as a specimen or dominant plant, and in avenues planting. Ziziphus jujuba is a screen and shelter plant, suitable for urban areas, public open spaces, park planting, private gardens and street planting.","description","Ziziphus jujuba is known by its common names of Chinese Date, Red Date and Chinese Jujube.

"Riyadh","Zoysia japonica","description","Zoysia, sometimes called Japanese lawn grass or Korean lawn grass, is a species of perennial, creeping grass native to Asia and Australia. It is widely used as a groundcover and is useful in Arriyadh in places where lawnmowing is not possible. Z. japonica is a coarse-textured and cold-hardy species with stiff, pointed leaf blades, which are smooth with occasional hairs near the base. The inflorescence is a short, terminal raceme on a spike. Growing well in moderately shaded locations, it tolerates soils from sands to clays, both acid and alkaline. Zoysia is salt-tolerant and extremely drought-tolerant, but becomes straw-coloured when very dry or after hard frost, although it turns green again with irrigation and higher temperatures. Zoysia requires regular irrigation during the summer. During dry winter months, Zoysia needs only occasional watering. Zoysia is propagated from seed, is available commercially as turf, and can also be established by planting plugs; the best time for planting is early summer. It can form dense mats, and sometimes makes little hillocks and even mounds that grow over low features. Used on golf courses, Zoysia also stops erosion on slopes and repels weeds. It makes a good lawn, but is not recommended for football fields. Sometimes chlorotic on calcareous soil, Zoysia should be fertilised monthly. Zoysia is relatively free of serious pests, although white grubs may attack turf: brown patch, rust and leaf spot diseases can cause problems, and fungicides may be needed on intensively maintained lawns.","description","Zoysia, sometimes called Japanese lawn grass or Korean lawn grass, is a species of perennial, creeping grass native to Asia and Australia.

A. nilotica var. tomentosa occurs in Saudi Arabia in wadi habitats and rowdahs on sandy and alluvial soils. Single-stemmed, this medium-sized tree with its flattened or rounded crown is easily identified by the long, flat, straight, velvety-grey fruits with up to 12 constricted round seeds, which hang like peas in a pod. Young branchlets are densely white-tomentose. The tree typically has a black bark with cracks exposing a red inner layer, which exudes a sticky, reddish resin, well known as gum arabic. The long spines in pairs are sharp, while the leaves are only quite small: fragrant, fluffy yellow flowers appear during winter until spring. Very drought- and salt-tolerant, A. nilotica is unfortunately susceptible to freezing temperatures. All parts of the tree have medicinal properties; its twigs are valued as chewsticks. Tender pods and shoots are used as forage for camels, sheep and goats. Propagated by seed, which may require scarification, direct seeding is common practice in afforestation schemes. It grows rapidly in full sun, in dry, well-drained sandy or silty soils. After establishment, irrigation can be reduced, whereby occasional deep watering will stimulate growth and deep roots. Planted as a specimen tree or in groups in a desert or extensive landscape situation, the tree, with sufficient space, makes a beautiful silhouette. Unless frequently pruned to preserve its shape, the tree becomes leggy.","description","Usually referred to by its synonym, Acacia arabica or sant al arabi, owing to its occurence on the Arabian Peninsula.

Aloes are very tolerant of soil pH, tolerating alkalinity, but they require good drainage, often growing on rocky slopes in the wild. Too much water damages the root system. Giant Aloes will tolerate full sun, but may develop brown leaf tips if sun exposure goes hand in hand with prolonged drought. Dead leaves are retained for many years, unless removed by the gardener. Dead floral stems should also be cut off, to achieve a neat appearance. Although they survive with little water, the foliage may become dull green in extreme drought. They soon recover from discolouration when watered. Frost immediately causes damage, beginning with flabby leaf tips up to total loss in just one night. Its pointed, light-green leaves are succulent and spines are aligned along the margins. This armour should be reason enough not to place it next to pedestrian areas. Giant Aloes make accent plants in rock gardens and are easy to combine with other succulents. Being used to little amounts of soil, they make very good container plants.

In a garden setting with ample irrigation, the plant adds a spot of striking colour, especially if the red-leaved varieties are chosen. This is a compact, herbaceous perennial, planted for its crisped and corrugated leaves which, according to variety, may be a stunning green or red in colour. The small, pale flowers are quite insignificant, although they are in bloom all year. Relatively frost-tolerant, it is propagated from cuttings, 2 to 5 cm in length. These root quickly and are best planted in organically rich, consistently moist, but not too wet, well-drained soils in full sun, or in partial shade. Alternatively, seed can be sown as soon as ripe. As a perennial, the plants can also be divided in spring. Maintenance includes pinching stems or moderate shearing to keep the plants compact and bushy. A. ficoidea is susceptible to nematodes and mealybugs, and often becomes very patchy; spider mites should be hosed off with water and fusarium wilt is combated by reducing water and removing infected plants. Useful for edgings and carpet-bedding in beds, borders, containers, or under trees and shrubs, it can also be grown as a cool-season annual in hot climates. Good in a formal garden or for seasonal interest. Plant 10 to 25 cm apart for groundcover effect. It will need replacing after a very hard frost.

A very wind-hardy plant, it requires full sun and tolerates severe conditions of drought, reportedly surviving several years without rainfall; frost resistance is good. A. halimus is often cultivated as forage for sheep and camels. It excretes salt through hairs on its leaves, which have a salty flavour. It is easily propagated by seed, but germination is very sensitive to salinity and, as a pretreatment, the seeds should be washed to remove salts from their surface and then soaked in water. Cuttings of soft wood, or mature wood of the current season’s growth, are also possible. Deep-rooting, the plant is suitable for erosion control of slopes and for sand stabilisation. It is also effective as an accent plant, as a contrast with green-leaved shrubs, or for creating a screen. A. halimus can also be clipped into topiary forms and makes a good barrier or low-growing hedge. Generally problem-free, little maintenance is required; this shrub is at its best when given the space to grow freely.

"Riyadh","Calendula officinalis","description","Marigolds, which have their origin in the Mediterranean, are easy-to-grow hardy annuals, which seed very readily and once grown are even difficult to eradicate, appearing year after year in the same spot. In Arriyadh, they make a popular garden plant, and have often been used for winter colour on roadsides. A bushy plant with bright-green leaves, which are oblong, fleshy and have a spicy fragrance, they grow from 30 to 60 cm high and bear showy, daisy-like flowers up to 7 cm across, usually yellow or orange, often double. Propagated by seed, they are tolerant of poor soil, as long as it is moist but well-drained. Planted in full sun, they need regular watering until established, and are best when given only little water after that. In the summer, they will become scorched by the sun and need renewing for a winter display: it must be said that they are not particularly hardy to frosts. Prone to attacks by aphids, occasional deadheading will improve their appearance in the garden. Apart from their landscape value as a pot plant, in gardens and winter colour in public spaces, they have no great landscape value.","description","Marigolds, which have their origin in the Mediterranean, are easy-to-grow hardy annuals, which seed very readily and once grown are even difficult to eradicate, appearing year after year in the same spot.

"Riyadh","Calotropis procera","description","The Calotropis or Felt Plant is known in Arabic as ashar. It is indigenous in Saudi Arabia, but is also native to southeast Asia and tropical Africa. The shrub can grow to between 3 and 5 metres high, and about the same width. The fact that it is poisonous (eye and skin contact should be avoided) means that it is not often planted ornamentally. However, C. procera is an interesting plant and wrongly maligned. With its bold foliage, the leaves are light silver-green on top and velvety underneath; they are large, fleshy and ovate. The flowers are grey on the outside and purple on the inside, in clustered axillary inflorescences. The impressive fruit is a large capsule, which opens to release dark seeds with silky hairs for distribution by the wind. These unusual attributes make the shrub valuable for landscape design. Bark, roots, leaves and flowers have long been used as remedies for numerous illnesses. C. procera can be propagated by seed or cuttings. The shrub has a tap root and it grows very well in sandy or silty desert conditions. The Felt Plant can tolerate high salinity and requires no irrigation once established. It is an attractive plant for natural garden themes, in rock or steppe gardens, and as a specimen making a silhouette against a wall or in group planting. It can be used in both open desert and urban areas. C. procera plays an important role in improving soil fertility, and also improves the water-retaining capacity of soil.

"Riyadh","Capparis spinosa","description","Capparis spinosa has the common Arabic names shaflah, lasaf and malat. The shrub grows slowly to a height of 1 metre. It can often be seen in Arriyadh, particularly in cracks on the rocky edges of wadis. The branches with tiny spines in pairs grow from the ground and the 2–4 cm-small leaves are alternate; they have an ovate form and grey-green colour. The flowerbuds can be pickled to make capers, used in cooking. The beautiful flowers have four petals with stamens almost as long as the petals. The shrub is propagated by seed and cuttings. Capparis decidua has a number of common Arabic names including kerda and karir. The generic name is derived from the Arabic kapar. It is a slow-growing, small tree or shrub reaching a height of 5 metres and thrives on shallow, hard soils and stony outcrops. The Capparis is native to arid zones growing on rocky, clayey and silty soils in Africa, the Middle East and southern Asia. The branches seem to be leafless, because the leaves are only 2 mm in size. The bark turns silver-grey with time, and tiny spines in pairs are distributed over the branches. The flowers are bright red and conspicuous, and appear in small groups in spring and summer. In Africa, the fruits are used for camel fodder, where it is a very popular and useful plant in agroforestry. C. decidua grows on alkaline, sandy and gravelly soils. It is well adapted to drought, fire and frost. Both Capparis species are valuable for landscape design, afforestation and planting for erosion control.

Carpobrotus edulis var. rubescens has pink flowers that resemble those of the Red Hottentot Fig. The edible fruits are not at all as tasty as true figs (Ficus carica). Hottentot Figs expand quickly when the woody branches root wherever they touch ground. It fits in well in rock gardens, but may also be used as a ground cover next to a pool or along roads. Soils should be sandy with good drainage. Full sun is essential for healthy plants and profuse flowering. Supplemental watering is needed in summer, while heat and low temperatures are tolerated. The plants sometimes become bare when old, and must be discarded to prevent an unsightly appearance. Alternatively, cuttings may be placed wherever bare spots show up. In order to quickly cover a new area, the plants should be spaced about 40 cm apart. The fleshy foliage should never be stepped on. Cutting it back entirely usually results in the loss of the plant. In spring, seeds may be sown in warm, moist conditions. Much faster is propagation by stem cuttings that should be allowed to dry before placing them in compost.

It is, however, only seldom seen in the Arriyadh region, sometimes on farms or in sheltered private gardens, and is probably more suitable for a coastal setting. Carob is a tall shrub or tree which grows up to 10 metres high with an equal spread, and has a dense crown. It is slow-growing and often multi-stemmed. There are both male and female trees (the pods appear on the latter). The dark-green leaves are pinnate with up to ten glossy oval leaflets. The flowers appear in small clusters in late summer on pale-yellow racemes directly on the stem and branches. The fruit is more imposing, and gives the tree its name. Huge, green and later dark-brown elongated pods hang all over the tree. C. siliqua grows on sandy, limey soil with good drainage and is highly salt-tolerant. It does require some humidity, but once established it is relatively drought-tolerant, because of its deep tap roots. It is sensitive to frost. In ancient times, people in the Middle East used to weigh gold and gems against the seeds of the carob tree, which was known in Greece as keration. C. siliqua is propagated by seed and cuttings.

The shrub or small tree is distributed throughout the Arabian peninsula, southwest Africa and the Mediterranean basin. Lycium grows up to 4 metres high with a spread of 6 metres. It is densely branched and armed with tiny thorns. The small leaves are dark green. The 7-mm-broad, star-like white flowers appear in spring. After flowering, edible pea-size red berries develop. The plant attracts birds and bees. Lycium is adapted to desert conditions; and can withstand drought, frost, wind, grazing and heat. The demands on the soil are less; it grows on rocky clayey soil. Salt tolerance is very high. The shrub needs nearly no irrigation when once established, and has tap roots. Pruning will improve dense growth, and seeds and cuttings are used for propagation. Lycium can easily be found around Riadh. It is very useful for open country, as a coloniser, hillside plantation species, slope stabiliser and for environmental consolidation. In open landscape areas, the shrub is popular because it can be planted as a hedge or windbreak and also provides fodder for livestock. Natural planting themes such as rock or steppe gardens can be created with Lycium shawii planted as dominant, grouped plant or as a hedge. A relative of Boxthron, the Goji, became very popular, because it is very healthy, rich in vitamins and mineral nutrients.","description","Lycium shawii is called awsaj or shaz in Arabic, while the English common name is Boxthorn or Desert-Thorn.

The fast-growing Cat’s Claw can reach 8 metres in height. It is still traded frequently under its outdated generic names Bignonia and Doxantha. Glossy, evergreen leaves are borne in pairs and end in three-clawed tendrils that adhere to most surfaces except glass or metal. Bright-yellow flowers appear from late spring to autumn. They are followed by brown, bean-like pods with seeds that germinate easily. Transplanting should be done carefully without disturbing the sensitive roots and the upright, spherical tuber. It is recommended that the stems be cut to the ground after planting, since only new growth attaches itself to supports. This radical treatment allows it to cling faster. Once established, this climber tolerates full sun, but partial shade and some drought are also tolerated, while still resulting in a lush appearance. It resists heat and frost up to –9C. It tolerates a wide range of soils, but revels in nutritious ground with a high humus content and frequent irrigation. Maintaining this plant can cause skin irritation. Owing to its rampant growth, the Cat’s Claw needs some containment if planted next to buildings. Pruning may be necessary to keep the climber from getting too heavy. It is better located near walls or escarpments which can be overgrown. Stems without support hang down forming a curtain of filigree leaves. It is occasionally seen in Saudi Arabia, clinging even to high building facades.","description","This vigorous climber from tropical America can conquer large areas with its self-clinging slender stems.

Its deciduous foliage is pinnately compound, some 18 cm long, with many pairs of oblong leaflets which measure about 2 cm in length. Attractive bright-yellow flowers are borne in racemes mainly in spring, when humidity and warmth indicate good conditions both for pollinators and for the shrub. In its tropical homelands, this plant produces flowers when the rain periods start. This species flowers in deep yellow, white and in intermediate shades. After the pea-shaped blossoms are pollinated, long, narrow pods develop containing up to 50 seeds each. As with other leguminous plants, the Egyptian Rattle Pods improve the soil by fixing nitrogen and adding humus. Their foliage is used as green manure and as forage for livestock. For its attractiveness and multiple uses, this species has long been grown beyond its native habitats, spreading widely in Africa and Asia. It is resistant to stagnant water and poor soil conditions including alkalinity and high salt content. Drought will lead to dormancy. Sowing is the most appropriate method of propagation, but the hard, bean-like seeds need some encouragement through scarification.

They create a dense carpet when they drop, which should be borne in mind when the tree is used in parks or large gardens as an eye-catcher. They form winged pods. As a tropical native, this tree goes dormant according to circumstances rather than by season. In Arriyadh, however, the leaves are shed for a brief period in late winter to regrow a few weeks later. Prolonged drought may induce the same procedure in summer, which should be prevented by moderate watering in well-drained soil. The tree may be exposed to full sun, takes salinity and tolerates light frosts. Alkaline soils should be improved by adding compost and applying acidic fertilisers. Young trees should be pruned and staked initially to form a straight trunk. Yellow Jacarandas adapt to variable conditions and tend to escape from cultivation in semi-humid climates. They are easily propagated by seed, and require only a minimum of care once established. As shade trees, they are ideal where their dropped flowers and seed packets do not create a nuisance.

"Riyadh","Maerua crassifolia","description","This large shrub, growing up to 5 metres tall, known as sarh or merro in Arabic, is native to the Arabian Peninsula. Its foliage is used as fodder for camels and is a source of food in Africa, where it is made into soups and other dishes. As a widespread, evergreen, and densely branched small tree, usually with a rounded flattish crown, it occurs in drier areas with sandy, gravelly and silty soils. The intricate, glaucous, spiny branches have small simple, often dense, elliptical leaves, which are slightly hairy and about 1 cm long. Yellow-green clusters of flowers with many stamens are borne in spring and the red berry fruits are bean-shaped. The seeds were considered sacred to the ancient Egyptians and there are a number of historical medicinal uses, as well as uses in apiculture. Shrubs are tap-rooted and have a high salt tolerance. In fact, they tolerate very harsh desert conditions, are hardy and withstand wind. The leaves and fruits are palatable to all animals except horses and donkeys The sweet fruits are also used for human consumption. M. crassifolia has good potential as a native plant for landscape design: it is useful in afforestation and for creating shelter belts. Requiring only minimal irrigation, whereby deep watering will increase growth, this is a low-maintenance plant.","description","This large shrub, growing up to 5 metres tall, known as sarh or merro in Arabic, is native to the Arabian Peninsula.

The shrub is native to central China, Japan and Korea. It prefers a Mediterranean to subtropical climate. It grows to a height of between 2 and 5 metres, with a spread of up to 4 metres. The shrub is usually regularly rounded in shape, and the foliage is evergreen. The leaves are dark green on top and light green underneath. The leaf shape is convex-obovate and entire, and the leaves are arranged alternately. The flowers are white or pale yellow, with a pleasant fragrance. The fruits are pale olive-green round capsules with a size of 1 cm. Maintenance requirements are minimal; occasionally, pruning will lead to a denser growth. Propagation is by sowing and pricking, by cuttings or through self-seeding. Mock Orange does not like stagnant water; however, it needs medium irrigation with a low salinity content.

It is a large, very thorny, deciduous tree reaching 30 metres in height in its native habitats on floodplains and dry watercourses. A fast-growing tree with a thick trunk and zigzag branching habit, the pale grey-green leaves are borne on whitish-grey, smooth stems and branches when young, which become grey and rough when older. The straight, whitish thorns are up to 40 mm long. The bark is grey, and fissured when old. Scented, pale cream-coloured flowers in long spikes occur from March to September, and are followed by large, unusually twisted, fruit pods, bright orange in colour. F. albida has a deep tap root, making it very drought-resistant, and it will grow in waterlogged soils and withstand occasional frost. For propagation, its seeds should first be treated with boiling water overnight before sowing. Young plants develop long tap roots and should be planted in the ground quickly. The tree is particularly useful in nitrogen fixation and erosion control, and is highly valued in agroforestry. It also has medicinal properties in the treatment of infections. Susceptible to mealybugs and scale, it can be treated with systemic insecticides. Large areas of the Sahara in Niger have been re-afforested with the Ana Tree, with great success. With its white twigs and thorns, it is an interesting specimen tree in a park or large garden with only low maintenance requirements.","description","The Ana Tree, formerly known as Acacia albida, and in Arabic as harraz, is native to Africa and introduced into the Middle East, India and Pakistan.

Another common name, Septic Weed, indicates that it occasionally escapes from cultivation found on disturbed ground such as waste sites or ditches along roads. In Arriyadh, this can be excluded beyond irrigated areas, while in humid tropical countries they compete with crops. If bruised, this plant exudes a foetid smell. Plants are poisonous, but rarely ingested by livestock. Any soil with sufficient moisture is suitable, and the shrub benefits from fertile ground with high nutrient levels.

Native to India, it is characterised by its thick, dark corky grey bark, delicate foliage and beautiful, fragrant flowers. The distinctive, bipinnate leaves up to 40 cm long have widely spaced, oval, clear green leaflets on short stalks. Attractive whitish-yellow, highly scented flowers are borne in loose clusters covering the whole tree in spring and early autumn. The fruit, up to 50 cm long, is a bright-green, ridged pod containing many seeds, which are a popular ingredient in curries. The tree grows best on a dry sandy soil and has a high drought resistance. In Arriyadh, it requires regular irrigation and a sheltered microclimate with a humid atmosphere. Propagation is from seed and cuttings. The Horseradish Tree is useful in many ways: its name is derived from the roots, which taste like horseradish, and the seeds yield oil for machinery, salad oil and soaps.

Native to India, it is characterised by its thick, dark corky grey bark, delicate foliage and beautiful, fragrant flowers. The distinctive, bipinnate leaves up to 40 cm long have widely spaced, oval, clear green leaflets on short stalks. Attractive whitish-yellow, highly scented flowers are borne in loose clusters covering the whole tree in spring and early autumn. The fruit, up to 50 cm long, is a bright-green, ridged pod containing many seeds, which are a popular ingredient in curries. The tree grows best on a dry sandy soil and has a high drought resistance. In Arriyadh, it requires regular irrigation and a sheltered microclimate with a humid atmosphere. Propagation is from seed and cuttings. The Horseradish Tree is useful in many ways: its name is derived from the roots, which taste like horseradish, and the seeds yield oil for machinery, salad oil and soaps.

"Riyadh","Paspalum vaginatum","description","Bahia Grass or Seashore Paspalum is a warm season turf grass, native to South America and growing in tropical areas throughout the world. It is a very useful ornamental lawn grass for Arriyadh. Spreading by rhizomes, Paspalum grows even where drainage is a problem. The leaf blades are flat, 5 mm wide and greyish-green. It requires full sun, sandy soils and ample irrigation, even though it has some drought tolerance. Paspalum does not produce highly viable seed, and therefore must be propagated vegetatively by stolons, rhizomes. It has the highest salt tolerance of all turf grasses. Regular leaching will alleviate the buildup of salts in the soil. Research has indicated that saline water could be used as a selected herbicide. Paspalum will also tolerate recycled effluent water, as opposed to Bermuda grass, which begins to suffer as salts build up. In lawns, it has high shoot densities and is therefore more competitive against weeds than other grasses. Few pests attack Paspalum. It requires much less nitrogen than other warm season grasses and is tolerant of a wide range of pH. Paspalum is shade- and drought-tolerant. It can be overseeded with cool season grasses and mown very closely. Paspalum is a useful plant in sand dune stabilisation. It is, however sensitive to cold temperatures, becoming dormant at 10C. There are several varieties of Paspalum vaginatum. Environmentally, Paspalum requires less water, fertiliser and pesticides than other warm season turf grasses, but needs the usual maintenance procedures for lawns.","description","Bahia Grass or Seashore Paspalum is a warm season turf grass, native to South America and growing in tropical areas throughout the world.

Large bunches of the copper-coloured fruit, containing flattened, oblong seeds, are attractive at first, but later look untidy because they remain on the tree for months. P. pterocarpum requires light shade to full sun, and cannot tolerate heavy frost. It is very salt-tolerant, preferring moist, well-drained, sandy soil. Being drought-resistant, irrigation requirements are moderate. Propagation is by seed, which needs to be scarified. Yellow Poinciana is an excellent shade, street tree and a specimen tree, if plenty of space is available. It needs regular pruning, when young, to keep the tree dense and in shape.

The tree grows fast up to 3 metres high, bears fruit early and has an angular shape with large leaves. It can be trained on a trellis to stabilise the branches and to prevent damage. Young plants are delicate and cannot compete with weeds. 'Trunj' requires a well-drained, sandy and fertile soil, with regular watering until established. Complete NPK fertilisers should be applied in early spring. Citrus trees have the attractive tropical feature of producing flowers and fruit at the same time. The fruit does not have any particular commercial value, but the non-acid lemons have a thick, bumpy rind that can be used for producing jam. The rind is low in essential oils, but gives off an aromatic scent and is sometimes candied or preserved in brine. Pruning should be limited to removing water sprouts, usually the result of severe cutting back of the branches of older trees. Most of these shoots are short-lived anyway and leave unsightly sticks on the branches. Deadwood might be provoked by prolonged drought or waterlogging.

It must be noted, however, that some maintenance is necessary, since the plant becomes untidy over time: watering in summer will improve its foliage and appearance."

"Riyadh","Ipomoea batatas","description","This vine produces edible tubers that can be oblong, round or even forked, and up to 25 cm long. Their skin may be white, yellow, red, brown or purple. Varieties with white flesh are firmer, while those with shades of orange are more nutritious, containing the vitamins A and C. Originally grown by Inca and Maya tribes in Central America, it was Columbus who began to distribute the plant. Nowadays, it is a staple food found in many tropical countries. It is eaten boiled, baked, fried, grilled or raw as a salad. Sweet Potatoes are also grown as pretty ornamentals for their attractive foliage, which is deeply lobed or heart-shaped. Cultivars show different colours such as purple, and are sometimes variegated. Flowers appear in shades of purple, pink or white from spring until autumn, but they are rather inconspicuous. Being of tropical descent, the plant revels in heat and full sun if the soil is fertile, well drained and not too dry. Although it may be grown from seed, it is usually propagated by softwood cuttings or tuber sections. Maintenance requirements are low, limited to training the shoots along the support. Pruning is possible at any time, and infestations by pests or diseases are rare. Sweet Potatoes become dormant during prolonged periods of cold, but remain evergreen in mild climates without frost. In Arriyadh, this plant is grown for its ornamental foliage, and large areas are often seen as a groundcover. It may also be planted in containers, hanging baskets or to hang over walls.","description","This vine produces edible tubers that can be oblong, round or even forked, and up to 25 cm long.

They are followed by seed capsules encircled by crown-like, pale green, translucent, wings. P. umbraticola thrives in hot, dry conditions and spreads rapidly to become 50 cm across. Plants will reseed themselves in late spring; they are killed by the first heavy frost. A slow-release fertiliser in mid-summer or fertilising every two weeks is necessary. Extremely drought-tolerant, they require only very moderate watering to look good. They will grow in either average to poor, well-drained garden soil in full sunlight. Maintenance is high with weeding and replacement: in midsummer, plants can be cut back by about 50 percent to encourage new growth and more flowers.

The tendril is a modified leaflet at the tip of a compound leaf which twines around anthropogenic structures such as a fence, or a natural support such as trees. Such overgrowing may result in invasions that kill shrubs or small trees in the vicinity. In its homeland tropical South America, where no frosts occur, dormancy may be induced during a brief period of dryness. Twigs take some frost, but protected sites are recommended initially, especially in Arriyadh. Plants recover readily after hard pruning, which is best done after flowering. Most striking is its spectacular flowers that measure up to 8 cm across. Abundant clusters of bright-golden or orange flowers show up mainly in early summer, and sporadically throughout the year. They are tubular, curved and waxy. They are followed by pods of 30 cm in length. Flame Vines do best in full sun with moderate to abundant watering, and respond well to fertiliser. They can be trained along a pergola, but should be allowed to drape over structures, since the best effect can be achieved when the flowers hang down. They are most often multiplied by layering and cuttings. They can also be propagated at a small scale by separating suckers.","description","In appropriate locations, the Flame Vine may present its vigorous growth with lush, evergreen leaves.

"Riyadh","Agave sisalana","description","In its shape this agave resembles A. americana though the leaf edges do not show sharp spines and the narrower foliage is not bent downwards. However, the tip is just as dangerous to anyone nearby. It does grow faster and develops a short, thick trunk. Flowers are creamy white. The genus' name derives from the Greek agavos which means 'admirable'. Easily grown in all arid regions, and as with many other desert plants, agaves do not like fertilisers and prefer soils with low organic content. Water logging in pots or rock may kill agaves. Healthy specimens are usually pest free, but mealy bugs or scales can easily be washed off the huge leaves. The flowering stem is stunning, but results in a dead foliage clump that needs to be disposed of carefully. However, offsets make new plants easily. Plants do not flower before the age of 10, but may take up to 30 years before doing so and dying. This species produces tough fibres that are used for matting, twine, sandals or brushes. Sisal for rope is probably the best known product. Native Americans made also medical use of agaves. Other species of agave suitable for planting in Riyadh, or occasionally seen there, are: Agave colorata; Agave palmeri; Agave parryi spp; Agave weberii.","description","In its shape this agave resembles A. americana though the leaf edges do not show sharp spines and the narrower foliage is not bent downwards.

Fragrant, yellow flowers, opening in clustered heads in late spring. Narrow seed pods are flat, straight or curved. A. karroo is a pioneer tree with an ability to fix nitrogen, but it is relatively short-lived (up to 40 years). The tree is deciduous in cold areas and prone to frost damage. It has a long taproot, but its roots are invasive; planting near paving/foundations should be avoided. Propagation is by seed soaked in hot water and left overnight; young trees are best fertilised with compost and bonemeal. A. karroo grows in most free-draining soil types, in full sun or partial shade. Drought-tolerant, the root zone should be deep-watered every one to two months during the summer. A beautiful patio-sized tree for the garden, its bright yellow flowers against dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark are highly attractive. Useful for erosion control, as a windbreak, thorny informal hedge, or barrier. Maintenance includes careful training of the leader, gradual removal of side branches until all are above head height, so that the long thorns are no problem, and also spring pruning of dead wood.

"Riyadh","Gazania rigens var. rigens","description","Treasure Flowers originate from the northwestern Cape, South Africa, and are now found both in warm countries as perennials and in colder climates grown seasonally. Peduncles of some 10 cm in length raise the solitary flowers distinctly above the leaves. The foliage is hairless on top but hirsute beneath. The flowers bear a ring of yellow, golden or orange rays which are sterile and centred by a black eye of fertile disc florets. The composite flowers may differ in size from 4 to 8 cm across. This variety is not known to grow wild, but from cultivation only. Gazanias grow well in poor soil and tolerate the frost that may occur in Arriyadh, where it is a very dependable groundcover. They can be used anywhere in gardens and parks as groundcover to hide dry earth. They are highly decorative in rock gardens and useful on embankments to prevent erosion. Gazanias tolerate a remarkable amount of salt in the ground. They quickly establish themselves after transplanting and tolerate drought. Maintenance is limited to lifting and dividing the plants when they become overcrowded. They may naturalise within irrigated areas, but rarely become weedy.

Peduncles of some 10 cm in length raise the solitary flowers distinctly above the leaves. The foliage is hairless on top but hirsute beneath. The flowers bear a ring of yellow, golden or orange rays which are sterile and centred by a black eye of fertile disc florets. The composite flowers may differ in size from 4 to 8 cm across. This variety is not known to grow wild, but from cultivation only. Gazanias grow well in poor soil and tolerate the frost that may occur in Arriyadh, where it is a very dependable groundcover. They can be used anywhere in gardens and parks as groundcover to hide dry earth. They are highly decorative in rock gardens and useful on embankments to prevent erosion. Gazanias tolerate a remarkable amount of salt in the ground. They quickly establish themselves after transplanting and tolerate drought. Maintenance is limited to lifting and dividing the plants when they become overcrowded. They may naturalise within irrigated areas, but rarely become weedy.

Owing to its attractive foliage, it is seen more and more in gardens and parks in Arriyadh. The dark-green, shiny, oval leaves are brightly coloured with red veins, and the undersides are purple. Also very often seen is the variegated form, P. a. variegatum, which has waxy-looking leaves in hues of pale grey-green, rose-pink and white. The spotted, tubular-shaped white, pink or purple flowers are borne on short, terminal spikes and bloom for most of the year. The plant grows best in bright, indirect sunlight, is fairly frost-resistant and prefers some humidity. P. atropurpureum requires a fertile, well-drained but moist or sandy, alkaline soil, and should be watered regularly. Plants require fertilising every few weeks during the spring and summer. Propagation is by greenwood or hardwood cuttings. Prone to spider mites; nematodes, scale and thrips can also be a problem. The Chocolate Plant is an attractive plant for patios, garden borders and containers. It can also be used in parks, mass-planted or grown as a low hedge.

The plant belongs to the vine family, and climbs to a height of 5 metres. For climbing, it needs a grit or fence in order to twine. The leaves are evergreen to partly deciduous in an ovate shape in light green. The delicate flowers attain a size of 4 cm. They begin to flower in bright white and turn deep yellow while withering. The flowers exude a pleasant sweet fragrance in spring and summer. After flowering, black inedible berries appear. Lonicera japonica is undemanding in terms of site requirements. It tolerates some drought, hot winds, poor soil and hot sun, and revels in heat. However, it can be affected by frost because it prefers temperatures above 1C; otherwise it becomes deciduous. It will leaf out quickly again in warm weather. With constant adequate irrigation, it will look fresh and green. Although it is drought-tolerant, it will look mangy and sections will die out with lack of water. Periodic pruning is recommended for thinning and to control growth. Honeysuckle should not be planted too close to shrubs or trees, because it can take over. On hillside planting or as a slope stabiliser, it will control erosion. For Arriyadh, it is a recommended plant for screening, park plantations, public open spaces, urban areas in pedestrian precincts and the tops of walls.

The plant originates in the islands of the southern Pacific, where it withstands a considerable amount of salinity and still makes a lush tropical feature. High levels of humus and nitrogen are as important, as is frequent irrigation without waterlogging. However, fertilisation should not be applied until the roots have been established. Wind exposure and low humidity may result in burnt margins on the plant’s main asset – its gorgeous coloured foliage. Hues in bronze, purple and red make these shrubs an eye-catcher. Hardwood cuttings are the most common method for propagating the numerous cultivars. In spring, they root easily in mixtures of peat and perlite under some shelter to retain humidity. Varieties differ in the colour and shape of their foliage. To achieve a bushy shape, the tips of young plants should be pinched occasionally. In winter, they do well with less water. A range from full sun to partial shade is tolerated, but a lack of light makes the foliage colours fade. They grow fast enough to sometimes act as annuals in colder climates. As indoor plants, Copper Leafs develop better in soil-less potting mix that retains humidity yet drains well, and daily misting should compensate the lack of high rainfall, as in their homelands.

"Riyadh","Sansevieria cylindrica","description","Sansevierias are grown for their ornamental sculptural appearance. They form evergreen leaves with narrow grooves grown from the base that build stiff pointed peaks, round in circumference. Rings in lighter and darker green alternate horizontally, making this plant attractive all year round. In time, they become dense clumps up to 0.6 to 1.5 metre high. Several leaves form fan-like sprays and spread underground by rhizomes. They are easy to propagate by removing suckers or dividing mature clumps. Flowers are pollinated by moths, and accordingly the flowers open at night and emit a very pleasant scent. The flowering stalk may reach 0.9 metres height bearing pink buds that open to produce white cups. After the flowers are spent, the fan usually dies, but will soon be replaced by new shoots emerging from the fleshy rhizomes. Its drought tolerance makes this plant one of the toughest indoor plants and an impressive succulent for rock gardens, where it makes a dominant specimen. A small-scale plant for gardens, it does well in containers or in pool areas. This species is native to the scrub and light woodland of Angola. Recently introduced into Arriyadh, it revels in full sun, but does better in partial shade. The soil may be poor or contain moderate nutrient levels. Excellent drainage is essential, because the plant is vulnerable to stagnant water. Constant moisture results in root rot. The soil should be allowed to dry before being watered again.

Flowers are pollinated by moths, and accordingly the flowers open at night and emit a very pleasant scent. The flowering stalk may reach 0.9 metres height bearing pink buds that open to produce white cups. After the flowers are spent, the fan usually dies, but will soon be replaced by new shoots emerging from the fleshy rhizomes. Its drought tolerance makes this plant one of the toughest indoor plants and an impressive succulent for rock gardens, where it makes a dominant specimen. A small-scale plant for gardens, it does well in containers or in pool areas. This species is native to the scrub and light woodland of Angola. Recently introduced into Arriyadh, it revels in full sun, but does better in partial shade. The soil may be poor or contain moderate nutrient levels. Excellent drainage is essential, because the plant is vulnerable to stagnant water. Constant moisture results in root rot. The soil should be allowed to dry before being watered again. The plants will cope with hot, arid climates, and either acidic or alkaline soil."

"Riyadh","Convolvulus cneorum","description","The Bush Morning Glory is native to the western Mediterranean Basin. In Riyadh it requires a sheltered garden location; its relative C.mauritanicus is a potentially good ground cover, but both plants have a tendency to bare spots, which need replanting every few years. While most other Morning Glories grow twining this one remains a prostrate, compact bush of some 80 cm height and at least the same in width. The spread is often underestimated but should be respected since wide spreading roots impede transplanting. In late spring and early summer pink buds turn into white, trumpet-shape flowers with yellow throats and hues of pink. They contrast well to the silvery, evergreen foliage. It is lanceolate, hirsute and well protected against desert conditions. Leaves reach about 6 cm length and 2 cm width. Each year Bush Morning Glories show an impressive floral display. Flowers are some 4 cm in diameter and grow in panicles. In full bloom the shrub is almost entirely covered by flowers. This bush revels in heat and full sun and takes poor, sandy soil with good drainage. Clay soils have to be friable since over-watering kills the plant. Alkalinity and drought are tolerated. Plants are even found growing wild in rock crevices. It makes an area cover in steppe gardens or looks excellent as grouped bush in rock gardens when it sprawls over gravel and boulders. Unsightly plants can be renewed by cutting back to the ground in early spring. Sprinkler irrigation may cause powdery mildew. It takes urban climate, frost to about -7C and some neglect when established. Softwood-cuttings root easily in late spring or early summer and sowing is also possible.","description","The Bush Morning Glory is native to the western Mediterranean Basin.

"Riyadh","Gazania rigens var. leucolaena","description","This is the toughest Gazania variety surviving frost, salinity and drought. These characteristics make it well adaptable to various habitats in its homeland, South Africa, but also in Arriyadh, where it is a very dependable groundcover. Although resistant to dry soil, it appreciates frequent watering in gritty soil that allows good drainage. It needs a place in full sun where the flowers open during the day to close at dusk. Bright-yellow flowers appear most prolifically from spring to summer, and occasionally in other seasons. Only few plants produce as glorious a show of colour as this Treasure Flower every year, under the most adverse circumstances. The plants creep moderately quickly with sparsely branched stems reaching some 40 cm in length. Its alternate leaves are about 10 cm long and 3 cm wide with an obovate shape. The name leucolaena is derived from the Greek word for a white cloak, referring to the tomentose leaves. It makes an ideal groundcover in a rockery, but its silvery foliage also contrasts well in mixed borders and beddings with massed plantings. On top and underneath, the leaves are woolly-hairy. After some years, this Gazania sometimes sheds older leaves at the base and needs either hard pruning to regrow, or otherwise the entire plant needs replacement. Some cultivars have been selected with an even more prolific floral display such as ‘Sunglow’ and ‘Yellow Star’. Treasure Flowers grow readily from seed sown in early spring. Cultivars are better propagated by division or cuttings both in spring or autumn.","description","This is the toughest Gazania variety surviving frost, salinity and drought.

The lanceolate leaves are evergreen making the background for protruding terminal clusters of white inflorescences. They have four petals, as typical for the mustard family. Cultivars often produce flowers in lilac or violet for a long period of time. The flowers emit a very pleasant scent which attracts insects. After flowering, the plants should be cut back to restart their floral display. In containers, they make an impressive effect, spelling over the rim. They may be used for massed planting or edging and can cover empty ground wherever there is enough light. They tolerate full or partial sun and demand a well-drained soil. Other than these, the reliable Sweet Alyssum has no further particular requirements. Heat is tolerated, as are low temperatures, and irrigation may be done with some level of salt. The plant thrives even in crevices, still producing flowers in abundance. However, it also responds well to frequent watering and fertilising with slow-release granules. Sowing on site is possible in autumn, but more often plants are started in pots. After transplanting, it should be given some attention until it becomes established. In suitable locations, it may self-seed.

In Arriyadh’s climate, where it makes a good garden plant, it should be protected from full sun and drying winds. Short dry periods are tolerated, but this species does better with frequent watering in well-drained soil. To guarantee appropriate moisture and allow aeration at the same time, the ground is best improved by adding compost and perlite. All-purpose fertiliser can be applied frequently. Lemon Geraniums do not take frost, extreme heat is best endured in semi-shade locations. Plants stressed by adverse growing conditions are sometimes infested by spider mites or mildew. Propagation by seed is started in late winter, while softwood cuttings may be planted in late summer. The main flowering period is spring to early summer.

To guarantee appropriate moisture and allow aeration at the same time, the ground is best improved by adding compost and perlite. All-purpose fertiliser can be applied frequently. Lemon Geraniums do not take frost, extreme heat is best endured in semi-shade locations. Plants stressed by adverse growing conditions are sometimes infested by spider mites or mildew. Propagation by seed is started in late winter, while softwood cuttings may be planted in late summer. The main flowering period is spring to early summer. Some varieties have been selected with more showy flowers and another cultivar, ‘Variegatum’, features leaves with ivory margins."

"Riyadh","Arundo donax","description","Giant Cane, or ghab in Arabic, is a perennial grass which grows in both wet soils, primarily along watercourses, and relatively dry locations, where the conditions can be either fresh or moderately saline. Originally from Asia, it has been cultivated for thousands of years in southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. It is often seen in the Arriyadh region growing on the banks of small ponds or where there are culvert outfalls. A. donax can reach a height of up to 6 metres. The long, straight leaves are a lush green, and the flowers appear in late summer as feathery plumes, which are of a high aesthetic value in the wind when the sun shines through them from behind. Its rhizomes can spread invasively and create dense mats; the roots reach a depth of 1 metre. A small piece, split off the root mass, will root again further downstream, establishing a new plant. The plant is well adapted to floods and is easily propagated by rhizomes or seeds. The grass stems contain silica making them strong and flexible. They are also hollow and can be used as fishing rods and walking sticks, as well as for flutes. A. donax can be planted on the edges of lakes and ponds, watercourses or as a slope stabilizer. It is also used for wind shelter plantations or as a screen. Considerable maintenance measures are required where the plant has grown vigorously and the roots have become invasive; mechanical force is then necessary to reduce the stand.","description","Giant Cane, or ghab in Arabic, is a perennial grass which grows in both wet soils, primarily along watercourses, and relatively dry locations, where the conditions can be either fresh or moderately saline.

"Riyadh","Canna indica","description","Cannas are beautiful, herbaceous perennials, which provide a colourful display from red to orange and yellow, when their basic needs are met: rich soil with lots of humus and plenty of water. They originate in the humid tropics, where the more than 30 different types of Canna are native to Central and South America. New cultivars have been created, particularly those with almost black foliage, or very deep-coloured red flowers and variegated leaves. An outstanding feature is that they bloom almost non-stop throughout the year. The attractive leaves are large, broad, oval, veined and rubbery-textured on glabrous stems; the roots are tuberous rhizomes. Exposure to the sun is essential, although partial shade encourages stronger growth, and a lack of light may reduce flowering. Cannas may be propagated by seed, and the fleshy rhizomes of cultivars with their bright colours require division. All parts of the plant are frost-tender. Alkaline soils with a high pH may cause chlorisis. C. indica can be used as a potted plant, or planted in herbaceous borders, on the edge of ponds, and as a patio plant. They should be set about 50 cm apart and mulching the soil helps to keep in moisture. Clumps of Cannas look more natural than massed planting. High winds tear the leaves, and so a protected location is recommended, especially in Arriyadh, where leaf scorch could potentially be a problem. Dead flowers should be cut off to stimulate new flowers. Any ungainly leaves should be removed to the ground to encourage new shoots with lush foliage.","description","Cannas are beautiful, herbaceous perennials, which provide a colourful display from red to orange and yellow, when their basic needs are met: rich soil with lots of humus and plenty of water.

Favourable conditions let it grow into a V-shaped bush of about 2.5 metres high and up to 2 metres wide. High levels of humus are important, and it should not be exposed to drying winds. Severe cutting back is possible in early spring, if frost has damaged the leaves. It does well in containers, is an ideal indoor plant and makes excellent focal points or colourful hedges.

In dry areas, the plants appreciate an occasional spray with the garden hose. Fertiliser should be applied frequently to encourage a prolonged period of blossom. When the leaves turn yellow between the veins, iron chelate is the appropriate remedy. Usually this chlorosis appears where the ground is alkaline and lacks humus."

"Riyadh","Ipomoea cairica","description","The Cairo Morning Glory grows creeping as a groundcover, trailing over edges or twining as a vine up to 5 metres high. This fast grower originates from tropical Africa and Asia, where it is sometimes called Mile a Minute Vine. Its stems are glabrous and tend to root when they touch soil. The evergreen, alternate leaves are pinnately lobed, round in shape and some 7 cm long. They form dense blankets spotted with many funnel-shaped flowers up to 9 cm across in purple, pink or white during summer. The fruit is a brown capsule 1 cm across with hairy seeds separated in valves. These are used for the most common way to propagate this plant and may also self-seed to naturalise on disturbed ground, preferably a moist site. Full to partial sun suits it best; however, it thrives in shade but refuses to bloom properly. Fertile ground and occasional fertilising is welcome. If the soil drains well, the Cairo Morning Glory grows rapidly with frequent irrigation and does not object to sprinklers. It grows tubers, from which it readily recovers if frost has killed the leaves and twigs. These tubers may be eaten cooked or roasted, but are not as tasty as those of its relative Sweet Potato (Ipomoea batatas). The twigs were formerly used to make ropes. It withstands hard pruning best in early spring, but does not demand much attention if there are no slow-growing plants nearby that might be overgrown. It is often seen in Arriyadh growing rampant over walls and fences.","description","The Cairo Morning Glory grows creeping as a groundcover, trailing over edges or twining as a vine up to 5 metres high.

They are small, erect shrubs with herbaceous branches on a woody base reaching a maximum of about 90 cm in height and some 70 cm in width, depending on the cultivars. Evergreen, fleshy foliage covers the plant densely. The leaf edges are lobed, and the dull green upper side often shows a ring of purple or brown. Terminal clusters of striking flowers are available in a wide range of colours such as red, pink, lilac, violet, orange and white. A single inflorescence usually consists of five petals, but double flowers have many more. Although the flowering climax is in spring, flowers may be seen all year round, if spent clusters are cut off frequently both for a neat appearance and to induce the development of new buds. Garden Geraniums enjoy sunny locations, but will also do well in partial sun. The soil should drain well and offer enough nutrients for the plant’s vigorous growth. The plant takes some drought, but looks best if watered frequently. Light frosts are tolerated, but severe cold kills the entire plant. Pruning can be done at any time to replace the brittle stems by young shoots. Cuttings can be taken both in spring and in autumn. Sowing is a year-round alternative. These Geraniums are the ideal plants for pots, containers and beddings. They enhance mixed borders with splendid colours and suit both public and private sites. Regularly seen throughout the year in Arriyadh, they are most prominent when they are planted for a winter colour display.","description","Garden Geraniums are hybrids of various South African species.

"Riyadh","Psidium guajava","description","From tropical America, this tender shrub has spread to all warm climates in the world. In favourable conditions, it may grow to a specimen tree of 7 metres in height. Veined, evergreen leaves are arranged oppositely on four-angled twigs. The emerging foliage is reddish to protect it from intense sun. When the reddish elderly bark peels off, it exposes light-grey bark beneath. A common tropical feature is flowers and fruit found on the tree at the same time. In Arriyadh, where the tree is often found in cultivation on farms, the white flowers appear mainly in spring, measuring about 2 to 3 cm across. Guaves are self-fertile, so that one plant does not need a neighbour for fertilisation. The fruits vary considerably in size, shape, colour and taste: they are between 5 and 10 cm in diameter, round or elongated, grey, white or pink, with more or less taste, either sweet or insipid. They turn ripe in autumn or early winter, emitting an intense pleasant scent. Guave fruits can be eaten fresh or processed to make juice and jam. Cultivars usually contain plenty of seeds within the pulp, but a few varieties are almost seedless. They germinate readily so that plants sometimes naturalise where conditions are met. In humid, warm regions, they may become weedy. Guave trees do well in full sun, but resent strong winds and reflected heat. Young plants are tender to cold, but mature trees tolerate brief, light frosts. Any well-drained soil is welcomed, either acidic or alkaline, but a high level of humus is appreciated.","description","From tropical America, this tender shrub has spread to all warm climates in the world.

In Arriyadh, small flowers appear whenever conditions are favourable, from boat-like cradles to eventually develop to round seeds. These easily germinate to form plenty of seedlings, ultimately creating dense mats. It is possible to prick these offspring or take cuttings from stems or leaves to propagate Boat Lilies. They grow readily in a wide range of soils, as long as these are well-drained, and they tolerate diverse light conditions ranging from full sun to partial shade. Although these perennials re-grow after nipped back by frost, exposed sites should be avoided. In time, the plants become dense clumps which can be used as border plants, areal cover, mass planting or group planting with a spacing of between 30 cm and 60 cm. They do well in containers and are popular house plants, but they are susceptible to the effects of stagnant water and prolonged drought. A cultivar named ‘Variegata’ has cream-coloured stripes and less vigour than the species. It must not be exposed to full sun, because the variegation will soon be sunburnt. Plants should be handled with care, especially if cut or bruised, since the sap may cause skin problems.","description","Boat Lilies are stout perennials with upright shoots up to about 40 cm in height.

It can often be seen in Arriyadh entwined in fences or tumbling over house boundary walls. The plant has very large, heart-shaped leaves and its flowers are hairy, trumpet-shaped, white outside with purplish-pink petals inside, appearing in cymes.

The plant is very slow-growing at first, developing into a compact bush, after which it becomes a liana. Without regular irrigation, it will die back and then regenerate with watering. Propagation is from the toughly coated seed, which requires nicking or soaking in boiling water for germination. Flowering often begins soon after germination with sufficient irrigation and plenty of space for root growth. Best in partial shade, leaves may scorch in full sunlight. For best results, A. nervosa should be planted in rich, well-drained soil; saturation will cause the plant to wilt and the roots to rot. Under good conditions, it will develop a massive root system. A strong trellis system or steel cables should be provided. The major maintenance effort inevitably involves disentwining the vine from places into which it should not be growing.","description","A strong-growing, twining climber, which, with support, can reach the top of four-storey building facades, A. nervosa is a native of the Indian subcontinent, and has been introduced into many other countries in the tropics.

"Riyadh","Searsia pendulina","description","Several species of Rhus, which are native to arid regions such as the deserts of Arizona and Mexico, and also South Africa, have potential for use in Arriyadh. Renamed Searsia pendulina in 2008, the White Karee, originating from and now widely planted in South Africa, is a small ornamental tree which can be found in Arriyadh’s nurseries. Fast-growing and somewhat short-lived, it will reach a height of about 6 metres and a spread of 4 to 5 metres. It has a willowy appearance with a rounded crown, and many drooping, weeping branches, usually on a single trunk, the bark of which is smooth and greyish, becoming rough and scaly at maturity. The dark-green leaves are trifoliate. Small, yellowish-green flowers bloom delicately on branching panicles from spring through to summer, attracting bees and butterflies. (Male and female flowers are borne on separate trees.) The edible fruits are small round berries which ripen from red to black, and are eaten by birds. The plant prefers moist soil with good drainage, and flourishes in full sun: it is wind- and drought-resistant, and relatively frost-hardy. Propagation is easy from seed and cuttings. Regular irrigation is necessary until establishment, with deep watering later during the summer months. The wood is durable and is used for fencing poles. An excellent small garden tree for shade, the roots are not aggressive, so that planting at a reasonable distance from swimming pools or patios is not a problem. Because not much pruning is needed, it makes a low-maintenance street tree.","description","Several species of Rhus, which are native to arid regions such as the deserts of Arizona and Mexico, and also South Africa, have potential for use in Arriyadh.

"Riyadh","Ficus microcarpa ’Panda’","description","This Ficus is a curiosity in that it is usually grown commercially as a bonsai tree. It was first seen in containers in Arriyadh nurseries and has been planted outside shops and restaurant windows principally because it grows compactly and can easily be pruned to shape. Often available in a spherical shape on a stem, F. panda shares all of the requirements of F. m. var. nitida, and the same applies to its ability to withstand frost and sun. It has light, almost round, thick leaves, which alternate up the stem and a brown to reddish bark dotted with small horizontal flecks. It can be propagated easily from cuttings. It suffers from several diseases, including black fly, scale, thrips and eelworm, as well as fungus and rot. Probably a variety of Ficus microcarpa, it seems to have originated in nurseries catering for indoor plants and was then exported to nurseries in the Gulf States, where it has thrived in the coastal climate and made an excellent hedge plant. In the US, two new forms of F. microcarpa entered the Florida trade in the mid 1970s (CE) under the names Ficus ‘Green Island’ and Ficus microcarpa var. crassifolia ‘Green Mound’. Both have been sold as Ficus ‘Panda’ or Ficus americana ‘Panda’ in Europe. They tend to spread out and are easy to train as a ground-hugging shrub. For best results, F. panda is best planted in a sheltered position, in the humid environment of a well-irrigated garden. F. panda is also a good screening or background shrub that needs almost no pruning to stay dense and trim.","description","This Ficus is a curiosity in that it is usually grown commercially as a bonsai tree.

"Riyadh","Argyreia campanulata","description","Native to India and southeast Asia, this tall, rangy and fast-growing shrub with multi-stems can grow up to 3 metres high. It is not planted in Arriyadh as often as it used to be, but is still occasionally found on farms. The large, heart-shaped leaves are dark green with velvety undersides. Numerous, large, funnel-shaped, pinkish-lilac flowers, appearing in clusters, last only a day or two, but the shrub is an all-year bloomer. Berry-like fruits produce many seeds. A. campanulata grows in many soils, especially well in sandy soil, and requires full sun. The shrub is drought-tolerant, but wilts completely after a long period without irrigation; it is also not hardy in a spell of heavy frost. Propagation is by hardwood cuttings. Pruning and irrigation should be carried out regularly to improve the shrub’s appearance. Valuable as a dense screen or informal hedge, the lush, green foliage and bright flowers make this shrub a valuable background plant for a park or large garden, or as a contrast in a desert scheme.","description","Native to India and southeast Asia, this tall, rangy and fast-growing shrub with multi-stems can grow up to 3 metres high.
