"Riyadh","Acacia ehrenbergiana","description","A common, large and spiny, desert shrub or small tree, on the Arabian Peninsula, A. ehrenbergianaA common, large and spiny, desert shrub or small tree, on the Arabian Peninsula, A. ehrenbergiana is known in Arabic as salam, and grows in groups in depressions and wadis, where rainwater runoff and fine waterborne sediment collect. The tree usually has multiple branches from the ground, with a greenish-brown, peeling bark, similar to that of Acacia seyal, with which it can be confused. In comparison, the whitish thorns of A. ehrenbergiana are longer than the leaves. Flowers are borne in yellow heads; seed pods are long, up to 10 cm. The tree has many uses in the desert: it is browsed by camels, pollarded for stock, produces an edible gum, is used for firewood and fodder; fibre ropes are made from the bark, and a liquid medicine known as Qataran is extracted for use in treating animal and human skin parasites. The heavy fluid is also used to protect the trunks of fruit trees from insects and fungi. A. ehrenbergiana regrows well from cut stumps, and can be propagated by seed mixed with animal manure, which helps acacia seeds to germinate better. The tree is famously used in beekeeping, producing good-quality salam honey. The trees usually grow randomly about 5 metres apart. One of the most drought-tolerant of acacias, it can gradually be weaned off watering altogether, after initial irrigation during the first year after planting. High growth rates occur during a heavy rain season. Owing to its drought tolerance, the tree can be planted in extensive landscape schemes, where a natural desert setting is the objective."

"Riyadh","Acacia etbaica","description","A tree with a flat-topped or, when old, rounded crown and a pronounced trunk, A. etbaica grows naturally in the coastal foothills of western Saudi Arabia on limestone and granite rocky slopes, and in the sandy sediments of wadis. It is often predominant in the scrub vegetation of a semi-desert. It has brown, fissured bark, and bears white flowers on few-flowered heads; branches, leaves and seed pods are glabrous. The fruit is a purplish-red oblong pod, also shiny and straight. The tree has several subspecies in Africa which have thorns that are straight, hooked or a mixture of both. A. etbaica is a good source of firewood and timber. The bark has medicinal properties. As with other indigenous acacias, and owing to its high drought tolerance, the tree has a landscape value and can be planted in extensive landscape schemes, where a natural woodland setting is the objective."

"Riyadh","Acacia farnesiana","description","Many of the acacias have fragrant flowers, but the beautiful scent of the sweet acacia in the gardens of Arriyadh in spring is unforgettable. A. farnesiana (known in Arabic as anbar or futnah) is a vase-shaped, small, thorny tree, often with multiple trunks and a spreading rounded crown. Its lacy leaves are evergreen in mild winters, but semi-deciduous after frost. The intensely fragrant, yellow puffball flowers emerge over a long period to open in Arriyadh in the spring. Native to the countries surrounding the Caribbean, the tree‘s blossoming can, however, be spoiled by late hard frosts. It has landscape value as an accent tree, especially in small gardens or patios, but can also be planted as a roadside tree, along pedestrian paths or as a background screen. Unfortunately, it has become invasive in some countries. A. farnesiana is extensively cultivated in southern France. A perfume is distilled from the flowers. Amongst other uses, the world over, the tree’s seed pods and bark are used for tanning and dying leather. Bark, leaves and roots are used for medicinal purposes. Sweet acacia honey is much prized. Gum exuding from the trunk can also be used like gum arabic. Trees are planted as fences and to check erosion. Its wood is hard and durable. Tolerant of most soils, it needs moisture to develop well during the summer and will respond well to deep watering. The tree is best propagated by scarifying ripe seeds and should be pruned regularly to maintain good shape and to remove any dead branches caused by cold winters."

"Riyadh","Acacia ligulata","description","Endemic to Australia, A. ligulata is one of the most widely distributed plants in the country, occurring usually on red sand dunes. It is a dense, dome-shaped, and spreading shrub from 1 to 5 metres in height. The common name, Umbrella Wattle, arises from the fact that the lower 45 cm of the trunk is defoliated by herbivores. Its many fine, light-brown branchlets are often scurfy and distinctly yellow-ribbed. The narrow leaves vary in size from 4 to 10 cm; flowers are golden-yellow in colour, held in spherical clusters appearing mainly in spring. Long fruit pods are brown, often with a lighter stripe. A. ligulata can be confused with A. salicina, because it is closely related to A. bivenosa, and the latter two seem to have hybridised. Leaves and branches are used medicinally by Australian aborigines; the seeds and gum also as a food source. Readily germinates in disturbed soils. A hardy, frost-tolerant shrub, it will develop into a small tree with pruning. Tolerant of extended dry periods up to 8 months. Propagated by seed, A. ligulata is a fast-growing perennial on well-drained, alkaline and light to heavy soils. A. ligulata has been selected from the exotic acacias as having potential for planting in Arriyadh and is highly suitable for extensive landscape design. It is useful for soil erosion control, sand stabilisation, low windbreaks and is good as a fast-growing screen. Few maintenance requirements, but, owing to its rapid regeneration, the shrub may become invasive under favourable conditions."

"Riyadh","Acacia nilotica","description","Usually referred to by its synonym, Acacia arabica or sant al arabi, owing to its occurence on the Arabian Peninsula. A. nilotica var. tomentosa occurs in Saudi Arabia in wadi habitats and rowdahs on sandy and alluvial soils. Single-stemmed, this medium-sized tree with its flattened or rounded crown is easily identified by the long, flat, straight, velvety-grey fruits with up to 12 constricted round seeds, which hang like peas in a pod. Young branchlets are densely white-tomentose. The tree typically has a black bark with cracks exposing a red inner layer, which exudes a sticky, reddish resin, well known as gum arabic. The long spines in pairs are sharp, while the leaves are only quite small: fragrant, fluffy yellow flowers appear during winter until spring. Very drought- and salt-tolerant, A. nilotica is unfortunately susceptible to freezing temperatures. All parts of the tree have medicinal properties; its twigs are valued as chewsticks. Tender pods and shoots are used as forage for camels, sheep and goats. Propagated by seed, which may require scarification, direct seeding is common practice in afforestation schemes. It grows rapidly in full sun, in dry, well-drained sandy or silty soils. After establishment, irrigation can be reduced, whereby occasional deep watering will stimulate growth and deep roots. Planted as a specimen tree or in groups in a desert or extensive landscape situation, the tree, with sufficient space, makes a beautiful silhouette. Unless frequently pruned to preserve its shape, the tree becomes leggy."

"Riyadh","Acacia salicina","description","This native Australian acacia is a relatively tall tree with a weeping habit and graceful canopy of pendulous branches with long, thin and dark-green leaves. Occurring naturally in thickets and open areas, often along watercourses and floodplains, it develops into an upright, dense specimen with a clear trunk. Until now, this tree has rarely been seen in the Arriyadh region, but has the potential for more use. Blooming intermittently throughout the year, usually during the winter, the faintly fragrant, creamy-white flowers appear in pairs or clusters, followed by narrow seed. A. salicina is a vigorous, moderate to long-lived, nitrogen-fixing tree, adapted to clayey, alkaline soils, and tolerating poor drainage and seasonal waterlogging. It is moderate to highly salt-tolerant and hardy, but to severe frosts. Thriving in full sun, the tree is drought-tolerant, but the provision of deep water in the summer will encourage a deeper root system and good wind resistance. Propagation is by scarifying seed or boiling the seed in water. The flowers’ pollen has value in apiculture. Recommended for its foliage, A. salicina is an attractive tree for gardens or patios and as a street tree and in parks. It has potential for erosion control, although there is a tendency to sucker: this and the potential for its seeds to be dispersed by birds suggest that it could become invasive. Prune periodically to thin the canopy, to reveal the weeping character and to offer less wind resistance. The foliage is susceptible to insects and leaf diseases."

"Riyadh","Acacia saligna","description","Often referred to as Acacia cyanophylla, its synonym, and commonly known by various names including Golden Wattle and Blue-Leafed Wattle, this tree is native to Australia. It may have been introduced into Saudi Arabia as recently as the nineteen-sixties for use in wind breaks and sand dune stabilization and was known first as cyanophylla, which describes its blue-green leaves. Very vigorous when young, it also has the ability to fix nitrogen with its roots. In some countries, however, it has become very invasive owing to the fact that its large quantities of seeds germinate easily, and that it regenerates after cutting. A. saligna grows rapidly into a small, leafy, evergreen tree with a rounded shape. It can be a multi-trunked specimen or have a single, short trunk. Its graceful, arching branches and attractive, long leaves or phyllodes give it a weeping habit. Large, bright-yellow, spherical flower heads appear in early spring and late winter, decorating the branch tips. Its seeds are stored in the nests of ants. After the ants have eaten the seed stalks, the seeds germinate. Moderately frost-tolerant and accepting most soils, it is a versatile tree that can be used as an eye-catcher in a garden, for screening, dust and wind control or planting in wide road medians. Apart from occasional pruning and good staking, it is easily maintained, although heavy root suckering can be a problem and saplings must be removed at an early stage. It can be used as a reserve of high-quality forage for use during drought, or as a mulch."

"Riyadh","Acacia seyal var. seyal","description","A gregarious, common savannah tree, A. seyal grows from west to east Africa through the Arabian Peninsula: there are several botanical varieties. Its Arabic names include saffar ahmer; it is also known as the shittah tree. A small tree, thorny and flat-topped, it is distinguished by its smooth trunk and branches, covered in a mealy, rust-red powder, which when rubbed off reveals a bright-green bark beneath. Sparsely branched, the sweetly-scented yellow flowers appear in the spring before the feathery leaves, which have two straight, light-grey thorns at their base. Seed pods are long and narrow. Trees can remain leafless for several months, depending on the occurrence of rain. It grows on deep, heavy and poor soils with a high pH (6–8), and tolerates salts and periodic flooding, hence the potential for planting in rowdah situations in the Arriyadh region. It can be a frost-sensitive species. A. seyal is an important source of gum arabic, and of early dry-season fodder. Propagated by scarified seed, large cuttings may strike root readily. Stands of var. seyal can be established by direct sowing of pretreated seeds. Over 40 species of insects are associated with the tree: beetles may damage seeds or attack the wood. A. seyal is suitable for planting as a shade or shelter tree in stands or as a barrier or thorny hedge. With low maintenance requirements, the tree can be cut down to the ground and a new canopy develops, although mature trees do not recover well. Pruning of small branches necessary to keep shape."

"Riyadh","Acacia tortilis ssp. raddiana","description","A flat-topped tree, A. tortilis is ubiquitous in arid regions of Africa and widespread in Saudi Arabia, where it is known as samur. It tolerates the severe desert environment, as well as being hardy to frost, although it is vulnerable until established. With multiple spreading trunks and the typical silhouette of an inverted triangle; A. tortilis ssp. raddiana occurs in northern Africa extending through Egypt to Saudi Arabia. Its crown is often irregularly rounded, and young branchlets, leaves and pods are glabrous. It grows in wadis and sandy plains, usually in water catchment areas. With small, highly aromatic, creamy-white flowers in tight clusters appearing from spring to summer, the tree has characteristic, spirally twisted seed pods rolled up into a tight coil. Evergreen with small feathery leaves, which line the thorny twigs, it has a moderate growth rate and prefers sandy soils while accepting most others. It has a very deep taproot. A.tortilis is a key species in greening deserts in the Middle East, being important for people and domesticated animals; it also improves soil fertility. Propagation is by fresh, scarified, or boiled seed. It has landscape value as a hedge or windbreak and in afforestation, but is unsuitable for planting near to pedestrians because of its shape and thorns. Irrigation is necessary until well established, but deep watering during the summer will enhance growth. Low maintenance only, except for pruning to improve appearance; can be trained as a standard single leader tree."

"Riyadh","Acacia tortilis ssp. spirocarpa","description","Acacia tortilis ssp. spirocarpa is one of four geographically demarcated subspecies of A. tortilis, which is ubiquitous in arid regions of Africa and widespread in Saudi Arabia, where it is known as samur. The ssp. spirocarpa is restricted to eastern Africa, with scattered occurrences on sand dunes and rocky hillsides, on deep alluvial calcareous soils, often indicating a higher water table or drainage lines. It can also occur on lateritic gravels and saline soils, and will colonise disturbed sites. This species dominates some savannah communities and provides an important source of forage. A tall, flat-topped tree, under optimal conditions, it tolerates the severe desert environment – in Africa, its range often extends into the Sahara desert – although vulnerable until established, it is hardy to frost, With multiple spreading trunks and the typical silhouette of an inverted triangle, A. tortilis ssp. spirocarpa is easily recognised by its flattened, spreading crown and hairy branchlets and pods. Young branchlets and leaves are densely pubescent. It also has spirally twisted pods, long straight stipular spines and whitish fragrant flowers. Propagation is the same as A. tortilis ssp. raddiana. It is also planted as a hedge and used for sand dune stabilisation and shelterbelts. Irrigation is necessary until well-established, but deep watering during the summer will enhance growth. Low maintenance only, except for pruning to improve appearance, it can be trained as a standard single leader tree."

"Riyadh","Acacia victoriae","description","A. victoriae is a widespread native acacia of Western Australia, commonly found on sedimental deposits such as floodplains, along watercourses or alluvial flats, but also on rocky hillsides and ridges. It is a nitrogen-fixing shrub or small tree with multi-stems from or near ground level, favouring soils that are well drained and often alkaline, including clayey alluvials and saline loams: it is moderately salt-tolerant. As such, it has potential for more widescale use in the Arriyadh region. Foliage consists of dull blue-green phyllodes which are slightly curved and have a waxy appearance The strongly scented, cream-coloured puffball flowers occur profusely during early spring. Mature, papery pods remain prominent on the tree until early summer. Frost tolerant to –5°C and sensitive to waterlogged soils, A. victoriae is known to be moderately tolerant of protracted droughts, although killed when drought is severe, unless deep watering is carried out. Its root system is moderate to deep. The tree is short-lived, less than 15 years, while the growth rate is moderate to slow. Propagation is by scarified or boiled seed. This acacia is an elegant garden or screening plant and makes an excellent windbreak. Sometimes forming thickets, it is also used to prevent erosion and remediate mine sites. The tree forms root suckers. There is a high potential for the tree to become weedy or invasive. With a low maintenance requirement, it will withstand clipping well. When blooming and seeding, this tree needs supplemental irrigation."

"Riyadh","Acalypha hispida","description","The Chenille Plant is an attractive shrub, some 3 metres high, that originates from southeast Asia. A lush impact may be achieved by dark-green leaves of about 15 cm in length. They contrast well with the bright red, furry catkins. The latter may become up to 50 cm long, and account for common names such as Fox Tail or Red Hot Cat‘s Tail. Scattered blooming all year round makes the female Chenille Plant highly desirable for use in planting. It flowers most heavily in early summer. Propagation by seeds and cuttings is easily possible; note that the more attractive flowers are borne on female plants. It sometimes naturalises in favourable conditions but does not become a nuisance in Arriyadh, owing to a lack of water beyond irrigated areas. It can be used as an accent plant or flowering hedge. Severe pruning results in lush, rejuvenated growth and is an appropriate method to keep a neat habit. Its size can also be controlled by pinching the tips and pruning without damaging the leaves. It tolerates heavy and alkaline soil, but needs frequent watering if exposed to full sun. Partial sun and even some shade suit it better. Wind and low humidity may provoke dried leaf margins; these should be avoided by choosing the right planting location carefully. It is vulnerable to industrial fumes and urban microclimates. The Chenille Plant is rarely affected by pests. If grown indoors, it may occasionally be infested by scales. It should be considered that the plant is poisonous if eaten by animals."

"Riyadh","Acalypha wilkesiana","description","On suitable sites, these shrubs create dense mounds of showy leaves while the flowers are insignificant. Copper Leafs grow fairly fast to about 2.5 metres in height. The plant originates in the islands of the southern Pacific, where it withstands a considerable amount of salinity and still makes a lush tropical feature. High levels of humus and nitrogen are as important, as is frequent irrigation without waterlogging. However, fertilisation should not be applied until the roots have been established. Wind exposure and low humidity may result in burnt margins on the plant's main asset – its gorgeous coloured foliage. Hues in bronze, purple and red make these shrubs an eye-catcher. Hardwood cuttings are the most common method for propagating the numerous cultivars. In spring, they root easily in mixtures of peat and perlite under some shelter to retain humidity. Varieties differ in the colour and shape of their foliage. To achieve a bushy shape, the tips of young plants should be pinched occasionally. In winter, they do well with less water. A range from full sun to partial shade is tolerated, but a lack of light makes the foliage colours fade. They grow fast enough to sometimes act as annuals in colder climates. As indoor plants, Copper Leafs develop better in soil-less potting mix that retains humidity yet drains well, and daily misting should compensate the lack of high rainfall, as in their homelands. Grown indoors, they are also susceptible to aphids, spider mites and scale insects."

"Riyadh","Agave americana","description","Known as the Century Plant, this is the most popular of agave species, which are native to the southwestern United States, Mexico and northern South America. It forms freely suckering rosettes of about 25 bluish-green, fleshy leaves up to 1.2 metres long and 20 cm wide. The lanceolate leaves have strong, hooked, dark spines on their edges and sharp tips, which may injure unwary passers-by. A position at a distance from foot-trafficked areas is essential. It is best suited to a rock garden, where it tolerates poor and saline soils, drought and heat. When grown in a pot, A. americana requires good drainage. The tall bloom stalks with flowers reach a total height of 6 metres, or sometimes even 13 metres. It does not take a century for the plant to grow, flower and die, but it is an astonishing event anyway. The stalks, which resemble asparagus, may grow up to 30 cm a day and then branch into cushions of yellowish flowers. Bulbils or baby plants, produced on the flower’s stalk, can be used for propagation, as can offsets and seeds. At this stage, extra watering is beneficial. The flower stalk can be roasted and eaten. A. americana usually flowers when ten or more years old, after which the plant dies: the dramatic dry bloom stalk is sometimes left as an attraction. Agaves are very easy to grow in Arriyadh; they have bold, sculptural forms, and are a strong accent in parks and gardens. They require only low maintenance such as tidying up dead leaves or pruning unwanted offsets. They are sometimes attacked by the agave weevil."

"Riyadh","Agave angustifolia 'Marginata'","description","This Agave is the right choice for locations that are limited in size. It is easier to manage than its larger relatives. The stiff, lanceolate foliage is armed with terminal spines and features cream-coloured edges with small serrations Leaves grow to some 50 cm length and about 10 cm width. Like other species, the Variegated Caribbean Agave may take many years to flower. This event only occurs once, and the rosette dies back entirely when a flower stalk of some 2.5 metres shoots up. Single flowers are borne in greenish-yellow and are 5 cm in length. Seedlings usually do not show any variegation, so that plants are generally propagated by suckers that are grown in abundance. This agave grows in full sun and, it is drought-resistant. It does best in well-drained soil with occasional watering, and other soils should be allowed to dry between water applications but before the plants start to wilt. It is well suited to containers and lasts for years in rootbound conditions. On the other hand, plants are vulnerable to stagnant water, especially when associated with low temperatures. Hard frost is not tolerated and immediately results in wilted leaves that do not recover. Plants are rarely infested by diseases or pests, but in adverse conditions they may be afflicted by scale. Variegated Caribbean Agaves look highly impressive in pots or containers and make valuable accent plants in smaller rock gardens or in any situation where greening must tolerate some neglect. Attractive specimens may be seen in the Diplomatic Quarter."

"Riyadh","Agave attenuata","description","For those who like the appearance of agaves, but fear the sharp spines, this species is the best choice. Its pale green foliage is leathery and soft with no teeth along the margins and a soft tip. Romping children will not get hurt by this species, but on the other hand, this slow growing plant takes a long time to recover from damage to its foliage. Dragon-tree agaves also differ from the other roughly 300 species by their short trunk up to 1.5 m in height and the offshoots at its base. A rosette consists of about 15 leaves that die, when the plant starts to flower, though other heads on the multistemmed clumps usually maintain the life of the clump. Bloom stalks may reach a height of about 2.5 m and are densely covered with many flowers and bulbils. The stalk resembles a swan's neck. All agaves tolerate heat, full sun and arid conditions, but do better with occasional watering, especially during their spectacular flowering period. It is, however, very susceptible to frost: it will survive, but recovers only slowly. A. attenuata is, nevertheless, a very attractive and successful agave in Riyadh, because of its tropical appearance and soft green clumps of rosettes. Planting agaves in bellied pots with narrow rims should be avoided, for removal of the plant is impossible without killing the plant or destroying the pot."

"Riyadh","Albizia lebbeck","description","When in good leaf, this is one of Arriyadh’s most reliable and attractive trees. Its compact growth and wide-spreading crown make it an ideal shade tree. It has bright, green foliage with large leaves that close up at night. From spring to autumn, the clusters of delicate, powder-puff flowers are very fragrant, particularly in the evening, deepening in colour with age. Often still on the tree during flowering and in winter, the flat pods, containing dark, round seeds, are prominent, and remain on the tree when the leaves have dropped, rattling in the wind. Their chattering noise has earned the tree the English common name of ‘Woman’s Tongue’. Unfortunately, owing to shedding of leaves during the hot summer months, the tree can take on a rather desiccated appearance, although this will be improved with regular irrigation. The root system is wide, but shallow. Fertilisation will maintain the lush green foliage and flowering, adding an accent to an arid landscape. A. lebbeck (known in Arabic as Labakh) is often planted in agricultural areas for shade, fodder and fuel wood, and produces dark-brown timber. It is an excellent tree for large gardens, parks and urban open spaces, and especially for roadside planting. Selective pruning of no more than 20% of foliage during the dormant season is necessary during the initial years to retain its shape and maintain a balanced branch framework. Plant during the winter: large specimens, especially those bare-rooted, may be slow to get started."

"Riyadh","Tamarindus indica","description","The Tamarind Tree, native to Africa and southeast Asia, and known in Arabic as tamar hindi, is a large, slow-growing tree which can reach up to 20 metres high. It has a rounded, dense crown of foliage, a short massive trunk and drooping branches. The bright-green, fine, feathery leaves are evergreen, elliptical and pinnately compound, with 10–18 pairs of 2-cm oblong leaflets. The leaflets close up at night. The Tamarind drops its leaves in dry seasons. It flowers inconspicuously, with red and yellow elongated flowers borne in small racemes. The velvety, cinnamon-brown pods are up to 15 cm long, sausage-shaped and constricted between the seeds. The fleshy, juicy pulp surrounding the seeds is both sweet and sour. Highly wind-resistant, the tree grows best in full sun in clay, loam, deep alluvial and acidic soils, as well as on limestone, and is moderately salt-tolerant. It is also frost-sensitive; young trees should be protected from cold. Although fairly drought-tolerant, the Tamarind needs regular irrigation. Propagation is by seed and also from cuttings, or air-layering. One of the major pests is the Oriental yellow scale, as well as several other scale species and insects such as mealybugs, nematodes, caterpillars, whitefly, thrips, cow bugs and the tamarind beetle. A bacterial leaf-spot may also occur. Tamarinds are grown as ornamental shade and street trees, and for their edible pods: beautiful and fine-textured, they make excellent specimen trees. Often planted in parks, once established they need very little attention."

"Riyadh","Allamanda cathartica","description","The Golden Trumpet Vine is a highly ornamental twining climber, native to northern Brazil. It may also be trained as a free-standing shrub and looks spectacular cascading over a retaining wall. Showy, yellow flowers measure up to 12 cm across. They spread fragrance and appear in abundance if the right growing conditions are met. They are borne in long racemes during warm months and are followed by prickly capsules which release winged seeds. Full sunshine and good drainage are essential. If stagnant water is prevented, the plant also does well in containers. It grows vigorously in moist soil with a high percentage of humus but low salt contents. Cold periods are tolerated, but frost damages the evergreen foliage instantly. It is low in maintenance and easy to lead along a trellis, a fence or into a tree. It needs to be tied, since it does not grow tendrils. Pinching keeps the plant in a neat shape, but may also result in loss of flower buds. Like many other members of the Oleander family, Apocynaceae, this plant contains poisonous milky sap. Allamandin is an iridoid lactone that may cause vomiting or diarrhoea. In Suriname it is medically used. As its species’ name indicates, it is a powerful cathartic. Propagation is possible via seeds or cuttings. Normally, there are no pests to be seen on well-nourished plants."

"Riyadh","Aloe vera","description","Since ancient times, the medicinal Aloe has been planted for its numerous healing qualities. Its exact origin is said to be northern Africa. It is often found on farms and in gardens in the Arriyadh area. Compounds of medicinal Aloe ease the healing of wounds. Upright, succulent leaves form dense rosettes of a bluish-green hue. To cope with drought, they even turn dull red. The small serrations along the margins do not present a hazard. Leaves form basal rosettes of about 60 cm height. In spring, yellow flowers grow like torches increasing the plant’s height to some 90 cm. These are followed by capsules later on. Pollination is performed by bees and birds; self-pollination is not possible. Heat and sun are no problem, and clumps become wider, even if neglected. For a handsome appearance, they should be groomed occasionally by removing dead leaves and floral stalks. The Aloe can easily be grown in well-drained containers. Potting soil should consist mainly of coarse sand, alkaline garden soil and some humus. Fertilisation is best provided by slow-releasing granules that are added to the soil in early spring and again in summer. Dividing Aloe clumps brings many offsets – the easy and quick way to achieve new plants. Seeds germinate easily too, but obviously take more time to show results. The seeds are ripe when the capsule is dry. It splits open to release winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Seedlings demand good ventilation and are quickly killed by overwatering. Pests are rare, but scale or mealybugs sometimes infest it."

"Riyadh","Amaranthus tricolor","description","The genus Amaranthus contains about 70 species, which are generally grown for their colourful, edible leaves and long pendulous flowers reminiscent of a fox’s tail. The Amaranths originate in tropical Asia, but are even to be found in Mexico in dry desert areas. In Arriyadh, a strain of A. tricolor with its dark red to purple leaves is often to be seen on farms, and, owing to its copious seed production and easy germination, the plants seem to have escaped their agricultural environment and now appear as ornamental plants in many places. Usually an erect, bushy annual with ovate, pointed to rounded leaves up to 5 cm long, the whitish-green flowers produce very small, black or red-brown seeds. These fast-growing plants can also be grown as perennials, requiring full sun to partial shade, and reach a height of 80 cm. Not very frost-hardy, they require water until establishment, but are otherwise quite drought-tolerant. Seed should be sown in spring in fertile, well-drained garden soil, although they will also do well on poor soils. Plants are subject to attacks by aphids. Amaranthus is used as a leaf vegetable, comparable to spinach: the leaves can be eaten raw or boiled and young stems can be served like asparagus. They also have medicinal properties and are rich in minerals and vitamins. As an ornamental in the garden with its attractive coloured leaves, A. tricolor makes a great impact in borders or in large planters."

"Riyadh","Aptenia cordifolia","description","This succulent perennial groundcover is native to South Africa and belongs to the ice plant family (Aizoaceae, formerly Mesembryanthemaceae). It retains its fleshy leaves all year round. They are heart-shaped, about 3 cm long and their bright green contrasts well with the tiny but numerous magenta flowers that appear in summer and autumn. They consist of string-like petals that enclose a small white centre, and open only during sunshine when they attract bees and butterflies. Flowers are borne in the leaf axils and develop into capsules about 1 cm in size. Plants will not exceed 10 cm height, but stems quickly grow to 60 cm in length. It tolerates full sun when the soil is gritty and not too dry. Even though its succulent leaves store water, A. cordifolia does not revel in heat or reflected sun. The plants may even become cholorotic and can eventually expose unsightly bare twigs that will not recover properly. Light frosts, as may occur in Arriyadh, do not harm this plant. In rock gardens, it makes an excellent groundcover. It does well in containers too, where it looks best spilling over the edge. Pruning is easy and possible at any time. Propagation by cuttings is simple and seeds also germinate well. There are variegated types or cultivars with different blossom colours such as white, yellow, red and violet. A. cordifolia is best planted in small areas in Arriyadh, where it can be used as a groundcover, in a rockery, a hanging basket or cascading over the edge of a container."

"Riyadh","Bauhinia purpurea","description","The Butterfly Tree, or khof al gamal in Arabic, is native to southeast Asia and thrives well in hot, subtropical and tropical climates. It is one of the most desirable of small trees with a fast growth, reaching a maximum height of 6 to 10 metres, and a similar width. There are many rather isolated occurrences of the tree in Arriyadh, but it will really look its best only in a protected environment with shelter, high relative humidity and frequent irrigation. Foliage remains on the tree in mild winters, to be shed when the extraordinary flowers appear. Cold winters may induce a brief period of dormancy when the twigs become bare. Inflorescences resemble orchids in colours from pink to magenta. They measure some 12 cm across, attract bees and emit a light fragrance. Its fruits are brown pods 30 cm in length, filled with spherical seeds. These easily germinate in sandy soil. The light-green leaves are bi-lobed, like a camel’s foot. They sprout soon after flowering begins. Growth habit is an open canopy with arched branches, and Butterfly Trees are often multi-stemmed or grow as a shrub. The plants should not be exposed to wind. Pruning in winter is possible to achieve the desired shape and it is recommended for young plants in particular. Frequent irrigation, sufficient nutrients, good drainage and full sun will ensure a good appearance. It will survive drought, but becomes stunted and will not flower if humidity is too low. Bauhinias are ideal trees in urban areas and pedestrian precincts even in containers."

"Riyadh","Bombax ceiba","description","The impressive Silk Cotton trees, or shagarit al harir in Arabic, originate in India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. In their natural habitat they reach a height of up to 50 metres, but in cultivation they usually grow no higher than 25 metres. Wide-spreading branches emanate from straight trunks. Both are covered by pointed, conical prickles. The deciduous leaves are pinnate, consisting of about seven oval leaflets of 20 cm in length. When they are shed, the showy flowers appear. Red, pink or white petals form a cup with protruding black anthers, and make this tree an eye-catcher in winter. For about four weeks, the 12-cm wide flowers draw attention when most other trees go dormant. A single flower is short-lived, but new buds develop during the flowering period. Trees should not be located where littered fallen flowers will bother pedestrians. Silk Cotton trees tolerate heat, but require good irrigation and deep, fertile soil. They are highly ornamental specimen trees for public parks and have occasionally been planted in parks and large gardens in Arriyadh, where they have grown well under good conditions. Bombax received its common name thanks to the silky floss that encloses the numerous seeds embedded in a woody capsule. These fibres, known as kapok, are used to stuff pillows. The calyces may be cooked as a vegetable,  and the roots have stimulant effects. The gum may be used as an astringent. Hardwood cuttings and air layering are possible methods of propagation, but are less frequently used than sowing the black seeds."

"Riyadh","Bougainvillea glabra","description","Bougainvillea, or janamiyah in Arabic, is a woody climber with an armour of strong thorns. It provides vivid splashes of colour in an arid environment and grows well in Arriyadh, although it will tolerate only a few degrees below freezing. On appropriate supports, it may reach a height of 10 metres with relatively fast growth rate. It tolerates full sun, wind if trained well on its support. The plant’s vigorous nature necessitates frequent attention and the branches require strong trellises or pergolas. In favourable conditions, the foliage is evergreen, while the tiny flower itself is white and insignificant. Much more spectacular are the clusters of papery bracts that come in shades of violet, magenta, pink, red, orange and white. Good drainage, nutrient-rich soil and frequent irrigation allow it to grow rapidly and produce a multitude of flowers from spring till autumn. During the winter months, the plants survive with little and should not be fertilised, in order to allow the plants to rest. Urban microclimates and drought are also tolerated, but at the cost of appearance. Bougainvillea glabra ‘Mini Thai’ is a dwarf variety with purple bracts. It grows slowly to a hemispherical, compact shrub 1.5 metres high and about 2 metres wide. This plant is best suited to growing in containers. Propagation is easy by means of hardwood cuttings in spring. Offshoots should be covered during rooting to ensure high humidity. Winter pruning of frost-damaged wood should be avoided, because it shelters new growth from surviving wood."

"Riyadh","Bougainvillea spectabilis","description","The generic name for Showy Bougainvillea was given in honour of Admiral Comte de Bougainville, who sponsored a journey to Brazil where the plant originates. It is probably the better choice for Arriyadh, because it is hardier than B. glabra. This sprawling climber is well protected by strong, curved thorns on hairy, woody stems. Its leaves are smaller than B. glabra and shiny on top and soft and hairy underneath. They last during mild winters, but are sometimes shed if conditions are unfavourable. The specific epithet stands for the spectacular colourful clusters of white, pink, red or purple flowers that appear seasonally, especially in spring. Three true, pale-yellow flowers are surrounded by bracts that make the magnificent display. Dormancy factors such as low temperatures or drought seem to trigger flowering. Its vigorous growth up to 20 metres, depending on its support, demands frequent pruning, and branches need to be attached to a wall, pergola, trellis or strong fence. Showy Bougainvilleas may also be hedged. Clipping is possible at any time of the year, but severe cutting should be done after the flowering season in autumn. This species may even be grown as a bonsai or topiary plant. Full sun and nutrient-rich, well-drained garden soil suit it best. In pots or containers, plants should be given a soluble fertiliser weekly, except in winter. On north-facing walls, the lack of light results in few or no flowers. The numerous cultivars are easily propagated by hardwood cuttings placed in indirect sunlight."

"Riyadh","Brachychiton acerifolius","description","Australian Flame Trees have maple-like, semi-evergreen foliage. Showy red flowers appear in spring when branches are still bare. Like flames the blossom attracts the eye immediately. They are small but plenty, bell-shaped and grouped on branched, red stalks. They are worth waiting for, since trees do not bloom so spectacularly until they are 20 years old or more. Both flowering and durability of its leaves can vary from year to year, presumably depending on climatic conditions. The Australian Flame Tree is native to Queensland and New South Wales where it grows to a height of about 36 metres. In Riyadh it usually does not exceed 15 metres with about 10 metres across, where it requires shelter against hot, desiccating, strong winds. The straight trunk is covered in green bark that turns light grey with age. Young leaves emerge in pink and turn green as they mature. They are deeper lobed than those of maple trees. In late summer boat-shaped fruits ripen and release edible, yellow seeds. Australian Flame Trees thrive in full sun and deep, fertile soil which should be low in salt. The root zone should be soaked thoroughly every month during the summer. Drainage is important and some humus should be added, if the ground is alkaline. Phosphorus is important and irrigation should be stopped in winter to induce flowering. Due to its uniform appearance it makes an ideal street tree. Popular in parks, it creates pleasant shade for pedestrians. Young plants should be protected from frost. Established trees simply shed their foliage in cold weather without any further damage. A central leader should be encouraged by removing lower branches. Fallen spent blooms and seed pods may cause a litter problem."

"Riyadh","Breynia disticha","description","This is a medium-sized, showy, tropical shrub actually originating in the South Pacific, but now gradually being seen in Arriyadh in intensively designed open spaces that are regularly irrigated and thus have the level of moisture that this plant requires. Its basic attraction is the variegated leaves, which at a distance look like flowers, and the white mottled leaves look as if they have been snowed on. B. disticha var. ‘Roseo-picta’ has a mixture of green, white, pink and red leaves on pink and red stems in a zigzagged fashion. The small, greenish, petal-less flowers are inconspicuous. The shrub thrives in partial or light dappled shade. Not frost-hardy, foliage will return after the winter. It is propagated by softwood cuttings in summer or root suckers. Pinching out stem tips when young will promote branching growth. The plants, which spread with their root suckers, can be invasive in a garden. It also drops its seeds frequently, which then germinate quickly underneath the plant. Good for mass planting, as a useful background shrub, or as an accent in a shrub border, it can also be clipped as a hedge or used as an edging plant. The dwarf variegated form is useful as a ground cover and the pink leaves are attractive in containers. B. disticha requires high maintenance, and, needs regular fertilising with nitrogen and potassium. Regular trimming promotes compact, new growth, and thus a new display of colour. Shrubs require regular irrigation and consistently moist soil, since otherwise leaf drop may occur."

"Riyadh","Caesalpinia gilliesii","description","The Yellow Bird-of-Paradise, known in Arabic as bonsiana gillias, is native to South America, but may sometimes naturalise without becoming invasive. It is a popular shrub for the desert landscape, thriving in heat and drought, although its relative, C. pulcherrima, is more often seen in Arriyadh, because it is more showy. Light frosts to –6°C, as may occur in Arriyadh, do not have any real impact, since the shrub tends to be leafless in winter and quickly comes back into growth in the spring. It will withstand poor conditions at the cost of its showy flowers; however, it rewards better soil and irrigation with rapid growth to about 2 metres in height and width. In summer, clusters of numerous yellow leguminous pea-flowers feature long protruding red stamens. These are certainly among the most exotic inflorescences produced by shrubs. Open in form, shrubs have slender, irregular branches with finely cut deciduous leaves. The brown pods are spotted and contain poisonous seeds that easily germinate when scarified and germinated. Little pruning is required to keep an attractive shape, but heavy pruning every few years results in rejuvenation. Landscape uses include flowering hedges and massed plantings, or as a showy specimen in parks and pedestrian precincts. During establishment, the soil should be kept moist while established plants will tolerate drought with occasional deep watering in summer. Slow-release fertilisers may be applied in spring. Low maintenance: pruning is necessary only to develop its natural growth habit."

"Riyadh","Caesalpinia pulcherrima","description","This Mexican native makes a more lush impact than its yellow relative, Caesalpinia gilliesii. Its relation to the flamboyant tree is obvious and indicated by its synonym, Poinciana pulcherrima. The shrubs may become tree-like in their native region, but in Arriyadh they remain vase-shaped shrubs to about 2 metres high. Only a few bushes produce such a display of bright-red flowers in the hottest summer. Panicles of exotic inflorescences make the Pride of Barbados, or zahrat al tawose in Arabic, conspicuous over a long period. Brown, hard pods contain poisonous seeds that easily germinate when scarified. Most result in red, or sometimes in orange flowers. Yellow varieties such as ‘Phoenix’ also appear occasionally. The foliage is feathery. Protected locations allow leaves to last throughout the winter, but they usually turn red before they fall. This bush is tolerant of various soil conditions and even survives drought, but heavy soils may lead to chlorosis. Frequent irrigation is welcome during the growth season, but supplemental watering in winter should be avoided. Light frosts are tolerated. Unsightly growth may be cut to the ground, when ammonium sulphate is applied in spring to ensure quick recovery. In most cases, hard pruning still allows flowering within the same year, and makes for a more compact shape. The Pride of Barbados makes an ideal plant for both gardens and parks with a floral splendour that attracts from near and far. It is striking as a specimen grown in a container next to a seating area."

"Riyadh","Callistemon citrinus","description","The Bottle Brush, or furshat az zujaj in Arabic, is named for its spikes of crimson flowers that appear in spring and summer. Inflorescences with no petals, but instead spikes of bright stamens, radiate from the twig’s end, where they attract butterflies. This native of eastern Australia grows as a spreading, evergreen shrub that may be trained into a small tree. Without pruning, it may reach a height of 5 metres and almost the same width. Its lance-shaped stiff foliage grows upward and exudes a scent of citrus when crushed. Young leaves are copper-coloured and turn deep green as they mature. The fruits are pea-sized, woody capsules that release hundreds of tiny seeds. The bark is grey and much-fissured. Full sun, dry air and some drought are tolerated, but the tree is prone to frost. Flowering is far less profuse in shady locations. Alkaline soils and even flooding are tolerated, owing to the plant’s origin on riverbanks. High soil salinity results in chlorosis that may be cured by applying iron chelate. Pruning should not be hard, and care should be taken in shaping and trimming. Propagation is easy by seeds or cuttings. Cultivars vary in colour, shape and size: ‘Jeffers’ grows more compact with magenta flowers, while ‘Splendens’ is an improved selection with red flowers. Other colours are shown by ‘Violaceus’, ‘Mauve Mist’ and ‘Perth Pink’. Bottle Brushes do well in containers, as specimens or grouped. They make a good screen and serve well as flowering hedges."

"Riyadh","Callistemon viminalis","description","This shrub from eastern Australia may be trained as a small tree up to 10 metres high, but will
require support until the stem is strong enough to bear the crown. Its weeping branches produce
bright-red flowers from spring onwards. It makes a terrific silhouette when grown as a multitrunked,
small tree. The evergreen leaves are up to 10 cm long and flushed with bronze when
young turning light-green later on. Full sun and fertile, well-drained soil are the main requirements
to promote healthy growth. Some drought is tolerated, while wind and overwatering may
harm the plant. Frost damage is likely to occur in Arriyadh, so that the planting location should
not be exposed. Some cultivars are available, such as ‘Captain Cook’, which is a dwarf variety.
The latter is reproduced by cuttings, while the species may also be propagated by seeds. Its
compact size and moderate requirements make the Weeping Bottlebrush an ideal small tree for
public parks and private gardens alike. Maintenance is little with occasional trimming to keep an
attractive shape. Pruning is best done after flowering, saving the plants’ energy by stopping seed
production. Standard trees require some thinning to adapt the crown’s size to the stability of the
trunk. Transplanting should be done in spring and watering must be frequent until the plant is
established. A dense screen can be created by close planting of Bottle Brushes. It is useful in a
street situation, good on lawns and can be grown in containers."

"Riyadh","Canna indica","description","Cannas are beautiful, herbaceous perennials, which provide a colourful display from red to orange and yellow, when their basic needs are met: rich soil with lots of humus and plenty of water. They originate in the humid tropics, where the more than 30 different types of Canna are native to Central and South America. New cultivars have been created, particularly those with almost black foliage, or very deep-coloured red flowers and variegated leaves. An outstanding feature is that they bloom almost non-stop throughout the year. The attractive leaves are large, broad, oval, veined and rubbery-textured on glabrous stems; the roots are tuberous rhizomes. Exposure to the sun is essential, although partial shade encourages stronger growth, and a lack of light may reduce flowering. Cannas may be propagated by seed, and the fleshy rhizomes of cultivars with their bright colours require division. All parts of the plant are frost-tender. Alkaline soils with a high pH may cause chlorisis. C. indica can be used as a potted plant, or planted in herbaceous borders, on the edge of ponds, and as a patio plant. They should be set about 50 cm apart and mulching the soil helps to keep in moisture. Clumps of Cannas look more natural than massed planting. High winds tear the leaves, and so a protected location is recommended, especially in Arriyadh, where leaf scorch could potentially be a problem. Dead flowers should be cut off to stimulate new flowers. Any ungainly leaves should be removed to the ground to encourage new shoots with lush foliage."

"Riyadh","Carica papaya","description","Originating in South America, this evergreen tree, bearing the papaya fruit, grows to a height of up to 8 metres and is often seen on farms in and around Arriyadh where other fruit trees are being cultivated. Occasionally, it will be seen in a garden in the city. The large multi-lobed leaves up to 60 cm across are to be found at the top of the non-branched trunk where the delicious fruits grow throughout the year just under the crown of the leaves. Not very long-lived – perhaps up to 15 years – the papaya tree requires full sun, but appreciates light shade in Arriyadh, obtained from nearby palm trees, which also provide the necessary protection against wind. Trees will grow in most soils, but they must be well drained and irrigation should be regular. Propagated by seeds, they suffer from mealybugs and scale insects. C. papaya is useful as a specimen tree in a garden, but does not have any real landscape value."

"Riyadh","Senna alata","description","This Argentinean native is well adapted to desert climates. Up to 50 cm long, its compound leaves make a lush impact. Generally evergreen, the Emperor’s Candlestick’s leaves may be shed in cold winters, but frosts known to occur in Arriyadh do not damage the branches. Without pruning, the plants form sprawling shrubs up to 4 metres high and 6 metres wide. In locations protected from strong winds, they may be trained as standard trees that eventually form picturesque, umbrella-shaped crowns. Showy spikes of bright-yellow flowers appear at the end of the shoots; these stick out like torches, and give the plants another common name, Candle Bush. The inflorescences are up to 3 cm across and are borne mainly in summer, but last well into the autumn. Pollination is done by butterflies, followed by brown, elongated pods some 30 cm long. Seeds germinate readily, providing numerous offspring both in cultivation and when escaping to invade the vicinity. Another method of multiplication is hardwood cuttings planted in winter. Soils may be low in nutrients, but need to be well drained. To achieve fast growth and a splendid floral display, this plant may be pampered by providing sufficient water and fertiliser. This way, plants quickly form dense hedges suitable for screening. Hard pruning in winter leads to proliferated growth in spring. The plants revel in full sun and heat, adjusting their vigour to almost any condition. Candle Bushes are robust in urban microclimates, and are good accent plants in parks and gardens."

"Riyadh","Cassia fistula","description","This native from southern Asia retains some leaves during mild winters to shed these just before flowering. The Golden Shower Tree, known in Arabic as khiyar shambar, deserves its name for a spectacular floral display in spring before new leaves emerge. Some pendant, yellow flowers still show up during summer. They are lightly fragrant. The tree grows slowly to form a wide canopy in time, reaching up to 10 metres in height and even 20 metres in its native environment. Often planted in Arriyadh, it does not always grow well owing the lack of humidity and to its susceptibility to chlorosis and frost damage. Its bark is pale grey and smooth when young, becoming dark brown and rough with age. The bright-green leaves are pinnate with pairs of ovate leaflets. Bright yellow flowers are borne on drooping racemes that may reach 60 cm in length. Single flowers are about 6 cm in diameter. They are followed by indehiscent pods that contain up to 100 poisonous seeds. It takes them about a year to ripen. When spent flowers are discarded, a second flowering may take place in autumn. The Golden Shower Tree grows in full sun but tolerates some shade, a little salinity and alkaline soil. Well-drained soil is essential and some drought is tolerated. Seeds should be scarified before sowing. In Arriyadh, its landscape value includes specimen trees in private gardens and parks. Falling seedpods may cause a litter problem. For frequent heavy flowering, terminal branches on young trees should be pruned to a side bud at the end of the flowering season."

"Riyadh","Senna corymbosa","description","Flowering Senna grows fairly quickly to some 3 metres in height and at least the same in width. It is native to subtropical South America and distributed in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. If watered, it grows well under desert conditions, taking full sun and heat. Single, golden flowers are borne at the tips of the branches most of the year, but in Arriyadh they are produced most abundantly in winter. Flowering Senna must not be exposed to cold sites, because of its tenderness to frost. After being hit by cold temperatures, plants quickly recover to start flowering in summer. Any pruning is accepted to grow this plant as a flowering hedge, as a standard tree or trained along a support such as a fence for ornamental screening. If left on its own, it makes a huge mound of slender twigs with smooth, olive-green bark. Its compound leaves are evergreen and up to 35 cm in length with elliptical, pale-green leaflets. Brown, elongated pods develop soon after flowering. The hard seeds should be soaked in water to ease germination. This shrub is vulnerable to stagnant water, especially if grown in containers. It does best in soil that is high in humus and nutrients, ranging from acidic to slightly alkaline. As a member of the pea family (Leguminosae, now called Fabaceae), the roots of this shrub grow nodules. They contain bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen which is essential for plants to grow. This way, the Flowering Senna effectively comes with its own source of fertiliser."

"Riyadh","Casuarina equisetifolia","description","The Horsetail Tree grows fast to about 15 metres high and 4 metres wide. In its homelands, mature trees reach up to 60 metres. It is native to northern Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and New Zealand. Often seen in Arriyadh on farms, where it is planted as a windbreak, it may be damaged by heavy frosts. Some people confuse the tree with Tamarix or athl.. In maturity, the crown becomes flat, but mostly the trees retain their conical shape. The tree’s evergreen foliage consists of pale-green needles, although it is not a conifer. The lower part of the straight trunk is mostly branchless. The light-grey bark is smooth at first, but becomes rough over time. Male and female inflorescences are usually borne on the same plant, but are inconspicuous. Pollination is by wind. Winged nuts are released gradually when ripe and are also the common method of propagation. Alternatively, cuttings are also used to propagate this tree. C. equisetifolia is tolerant of many soil types and both a high water table and several months of drought. Highly salt-tolerant, it thrives in sand. It enhances soil fertility over time by increasing nitrogen and humus. Its landscape values are stabilisation of slopes or banks, screens and windbreaks. For more elegant landscapes, regular pruning is required to improve appearance. Pruning should also be done frequently to remove old and dead branches. Severe cutting back is not tolerated. Leaf litter may be a problem, and aggressive roots may restrict the growth of nearby plants."

"Riyadh","Celosia argentea ssp. plumosa","description","Originating in southeast Asia, the Cockscomb is a brightly flowering annual with an erect, bushy habit. Often seen in Arriyadh’s gardens, as a pot plant and also planted for winter colour, the loose, feathery, plume-shaped flowers have a wide range of colours, including magenta, yellow and orange. The fresh green, pointed leaves are often bronze-hued. The plant will grow to a height of 1 metre. Propagated by seeds, preferably in the flowering site since they resent disturbance, they like rich well-draining soils in full sun and thrive on sandy soils. Regular irrigation is required and the plants are not very frost-tolerant. Like all annuals planted for winter colour in Arriyadh in October/November, their life is shortened even more by the onset of hot weather in the spring, and plants soon become straggly. Relatively pest-free but maintenance-intensive, the dying flowers should be removed regularly to keep plants looking good, and eventually they will have to be removed. Apart from its use as a colourful ground cover or as a pot plant, C. argentea has no great landscape value."

"Riyadh","Centaurea ragusina","description","A useful, drought-tolerant perennial with evergreen (or rather ever-grey) foliage, its serrated, pinnately cut leaves make the Dusty Miller interesting in rock gardens as well as creating a bright contrast in plant beds. It grows wild along the Mediterranean coast, from where it has a resistance to salinity. To keep it neat and tidy, it should be cut back by the end of winter, and if necessary by mid-summer, to remove the faded flowers. These are not produced during the first year; however, they are insignificant, and by no means what the plant is grown for. Low humidity is no problem and a little frost is tolerated without any damage. If neglected, the plants may become leggy in time and require cutting back to grow new attractive shoots. A variety called ’Silverdust’ is more compact and has silvery-white leaves. It also has fewer flowers than the species. Propagation is very easy, from cuttings. The stems are stiff and branch from the base. They make excellent cuttings for propagating the plant quickly. Dusty Millers do well in well-drained soil with frequent irrigation. Deep rooting allows established plants to tolerate some drought. Under ideal conditions, they may reach 1 metre in height and 1.4 metres in width, but in Arriyadh, where they are to be seen in both private gardens and public open spaces, these woody perennials remain about half this size. Pinching helps the plant to grow more compactly. They have low maintenance requirements and are pest-free. Wet conditions may cause a fungal infection called rust disease."

"Riyadh","Cestrum elegans","description","This Mexican native shrub has arching branches reaching almost 3 metres in height. Red Cestrum develops large numbers of tubular, bright-red flowers in dense clusters on the twigs’ ends that attract butterflies. The pretty display lasts from spring to early autumn. Pollinated flowers develop violet-coloured berries that attract birds. The evergreen leaves are lance-shaped and hirsute. High temperatures are no problem as long as soil moisture is plentiful. Alkaline soil may result in cholorotic foliage. Yellow leaves may also be caused by full sun in unfavourable conditions. The ground should be fertile and well drained. Light pruning can be done at any time of the year. Low temperatures are tolerated down to –9°C, but prolonged periods of frost may harm the leaves. They quickly recover in spring, since the shrub responds well to feeding. Pruning should be performed during dormancy, but the shrub tolerates clipping at any time to keep a neat shape. For this purpose, pinching out the tips of young branches is appropriate. C. elegans should not be exposed to drying winds, which may cause necrotic leaf-margins. Regular irrigation in summer is vital, but should be reduced in winter. Red Cestrum makes an accent bush in mixed borders both in private and public gardens. It grows well in containers when drainage, feeding and irrigation are well maintained. Flowering branches last quite long as cut flowers. Propagation is generally performed by softwood cuttings that need some shelter to retain moisture."

"Riyadh","Cestrum nocturnum","description","This medium-sized shrub is native to the West Indies and tropical America, and grows to about 3 metres high into a round shape. Night Jessamine, or malikat al lail in Arabic, is often planted in Arriyadh’s gardens and has a very pronounced sweet, heavy fragrance after sunset which attracts moths. Shrubs may be cut back hard after flowering. Shearing is possible to create hedges or any form desired. Evergreen, oval-shaped, waxy leaves are up to 20 cm long and 4 cm wide, and are sensitive to frost. Clusters of pale-cream, tubular flowers are borne from spring until October. Their appearance is inconspicuous, but they are famous for their sweet scent. Opening in the evening, the released fragrance may even be too strong for a permanent position next to seating areas. Pollinated flowers develop into whitish berries. The poisonous seeds cause vomiting and feverish symptoms, and the sap may also irritate the skin. The shrubs withstand some drought, alkaline soil and even salinity, but reduce flowering under such conditions. Heat and sun are tolerated and frequent irrigation is welcome in well-drained soil. They respond well to fertilising. Container plants do best with weekly liquid applications, while in open ground complete fertilisers should be given in early spring and again in summer. Scale and mites can occasionally infect the shrubs. Night Jessamine does well in containers, mixed borders or as poolside plants. Propagation via heel cuttings and seeds is simple and self-sowing may result in naturalisation in humid climates."

"Riyadh","Cestrum parqui","description","This Chilean native shrub grows quickly up to 3 metres high with an equivalent width in a somewhat straggly shape. The Willow Jessamine has yellow, fragrant flowers at night from summer through to autumn. They emerge in loose clusters with a tubular shape, about 2 cm in length, and mainly appear at the tips of the upright branches. Slender twigs are lined alternately with deciduous linear leaves that resemble the foliage of willows. They are shiny on top, up to 12 cm long, and release an unpleasant smell when crushed. In Arriyadh, where it is occasionally found in protected gardens, frost may damage the leaves and even kill the branches, but the shrubs readily recover and even flower the same year. Pollinated by moths or butterflies, they develop into small dark-brown, egg-shaped berries. These fruits attract birds which distribute the seeds. The plants may become a nuisance when they invade favourable sites, and their toxic seeds may endanger livestock such as cattle and poultry. C. parqui tolerates some shade, but does best in partial sun with fertile soil. Irrigation in summer is necessary, while it withstands some drought in winter after the leaves are shed. In early spring, it may be cut to the ground to renew growth which should be aided by an application of general-purpose fertiliser. Pinching out is recommended at any time of the year to keep a compact shape. This shrub looks good in groups and may enhance pedestrian precincts with its fragrance."

"Riyadh","Chamaerops humilis","description","The Dwarf Fan Palm is native to the Mediterranean area and one of the few palms that are naturally growing in Europe. These small palms are often seen in Riyadh, where they withstand occasional cold snaps with frost well. In the wild they usually have a single trunk some 4 metres high, while cultivated ones are mostly multi-stemmed. Unless trimmed the trunk is covered by remnants of old fronds. The fans are triangular spades 60 cm across and sharp thorns align the margins of the petiole that measures more than 1 metre in length. Yellow inflorescences appear in early summer at the base of the crown. Male and female flowers usually grow on different plants. In autumn tiny, inedible dates develop to 1 cm diameter with yellow, orange or brown rind. Dwarf Fan Palms are very tough and take full sun, wind and some salinity. Drought is tolerated by an established specimen, but stagnant water may kill it. Rich, well-draining soil and deep, regular irrigation are preferred. C. humilis can be planted very decoratively in Riyadh. They make striking accent plants in rock gardens and containers and look good in groups on slopes where they do not have to compete with larger shrubs or trees. In former times the fibres were used for making mats, ropes and brooms. Nowadays the leaves may be fabricated as a substitute for linen or as ‘vegetable horsehair’. Young leaf tips may be eaten as vegetables. Propagation by seed is most common, but offshoots can be detached from a clump. Maintenance is low: removal of dead fronds and unwanted shoots is occasionally necessary."

"Riyadh","Citrullus colocynthis","description","Citrullus colocynthis, known in English as Bitter Apple and in Arabic as hanzal, is a fast growing, prostrate, trailing or climbing perennial herb with tendrils that can extend up to 3 metres. It occurs throughout northern and southern Africa, southwest Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, where it is widespread, especially in the Arriyadh region, owing to its hardiness in the summer. A more common relative of C. colocynthis is Citrullus lanatus, the watermelon. The leaves are triangular, grey-green and deeply lobed with three to seven lobes. The branches are hairy. The small, yellow flowers appear in summer. The fruit is about 7 cm in size, initially fleshy and a mottled green with yellow bands. Older fruits are yellow, and rattle if shaken. The fruit was used formerly as a digestive, and the taste is very bitter. Nowadays, its medicinal uses are limited, because it can damage the liver. Propagation is by seed. It grows on sandy soil, is moderately salt-tolerant, and for landscape purposes little maintenance is necessary once established. C. colocynthis will not tolerate frost, but recovers during summer. The Bitter Apple is very useful for open land as a coloniser and slope stabiliser. It can be also planted in extensive landscape schemes such as rock or steppe gardens, and as a groundcover."

"Riyadh","Citrus aurantiifolia","description","Lime trees are usually grown as shrubs or small multi-stemmed trees. They originate in southeast Asia, and are, perhaps, the most cold-sensitive citrus. Nevertheless, they are not uncommon in Arriyadh, where, despite the possibility of strong frosts, they thrive on farms in environments protected by other trees. Large, white flowers in spring emit a sweet scent. After pollination, the tree bears rounded green fruits that turn greenish-yellow when fully mature. Deep-green leaves are accompanied by thorns at their base. Cultivars are commonly spineless and less acidic. They exceed the aroma of lemons. Limes require abundant sunlight, good nutrition and require humidity. Sufficient irrigation is essential in well-drained, fertile soil. It should be omitted in autumn, but wilting must nevertheless be inhibited. Some drought is tolerated if the soils are deep. Frost damages leaves and may cause branches to die back. C. aurantiifolia grows well in containers, near pools and is suitable for both public and private gardens. Commercially grown cultivars are grafted, but cuttings with heels meet private needs. Seedlings may show thorns and acidic fruits. Limes are prone to scales, spider mites and mealybugs. Pruning should be done in early spring before flowering. Severe cutting back harms both the appearance and the tree’s health, because wounds take a long time to be closed by surrounding bark. If their diameter exceeds 3 cm, the wounds should be sealed with a pruning compound. Frequent pinching out keeps a neat, compact shape."

"Riyadh","Citrus limon","description","Lemons grow on small evergreen trees originating in southeast Asia. The fruit has been cultivated since ancient times. Often seen on farms in the Arriyadh region, the lemon tree is also a good ornamental tree for the garden, not least because of the excellent fragrance of its blossoms. Trees may be trained to a handsome shape. The bright yellow colour of the fruit contrasts well with the dark-green leaves. Alkaline soil and high salinity may cause chlorosis, which can be cured by applying iron chelate: soil should be well drained and sandy. Seedlings should not been grown because they often exhibit thorny twigs and plenty of water sprouts. Many cultivars may be reproduced by large cuttings, while cash crops are budded to ensure maximum fruit production. Trees should be spaced 7 metres apart. They should be pruned to a compact shape and rejuvenated by severe cutting back after ten years. Weedkillers should not be sprayed, since lemon trees are highly sensitive to herbicides. Commercial growers withhold irrigation in summer for a few weeks until the trees begin to wilt. After heavy watering and high nitrogen fertilisation, an enormous bloom is induced in early autumn. C. limon is susceptible to mealybugs and aphids and a citrus virus disease. Terracotta containers with lemon trees have a high ornamental value."

"Riyadh","Citrus reticulata","description","This is the medium-sized, evergreen tree that bears tangerines: it grows to a height of 5 metres, and up to 7 metres in width. Once native to southeast Asia, C. reticulata is now grown in any warm climate in the world. Tangerines are an important cash crop and are easier to peel than other citrus. The open crown is covered with shiny, oval leaves with serrated margins and winged petioles. They are dark green and aromatic when touched or crushed. In spring, pink buds open to white flowers that exude an strong, sweet fragrance. After pollination by honeybees, the tree bears the well-known, tasty fruits with bright orange rind in a flattened, round shape. Many cultivars vary in fruit size, yield, fruit colour, taste and number of seeds. Widespread are ‘Clementine’, ‘Dancy’ and ‘Fremont’, which are usually grafted onto stock that tolerates adverse conditions. The fruit ripens in winter, which makes them highly popular when there are no fruits harvested in cold or temperate climates. Yields vary from heavy crops one year to minimal performance the next year. Full to partial sun is ideal with additional irrigation in summer, but less in winter. The most serious pest to citrus are leaf miners. Mechanical methods to get rid of the larvae that live within the leaf are impossible, and chemical treatment is highly elaborate but often unsuccessful. Prevention is the best way to avoid infestation, so that each new citrus tree must be carefully examined before planting."

"Riyadh","Clerodendrum inerme","description","This sprawling and climbing shrub, commonly called Indian Privet, is native to India and is widely seen in Arriyadh owing to its versatility and robustness. Normally a climber which will reach a height of over 9 metres and a spread of up to 3 metres, it is equally at home as a mounding groundcover spreading up to 3 metres. It can also be clipped or hedged into a variety of shapes and trained over fences and pergolas. The shrub has lush, bright-green leaves and small clusters of faintly scented, jasmine-like flowers that bloom throughout the summer. Growing very rapidly, but not very drought-resistant, it tolerates extreme heat, wind and salinity, even performing well in brackish water. C. inerme will grow in almost any soil and tolerates poor drainage. Regular irrigation is necessary to keep this shrub looking well. It is propagated by seed and cuttings. Plants are particularly susceptible to tomato hornworms, are often overrun by the parasitic dodder plant and have occasional infestations of white flies. Indian Privet needs frequent pruning, especially when planted as a hedge and older plants become quite woody after a few years, if they have been neglected. Maintenance is relatively intensive because of the required regular pruning to contain the plant. Often, the shrubs have to be removed and a new start made. C. inerme is a useful climber on a shade structure or trellis covering a wall. It can also be attached to steel cables. It makes a good plant for roadsides, if irrigation and frequent correct pruning are carried out."

"Riyadh","Clerodendrum splendens","description","The Flaming Glorybower, originating in West Africa, is an attractive and easily maintained, vigorous climber which makes a colourful addition to a garden, and is best planted in the shade in Arriyadh, where the light is bright enough for it to grow well. Twining in habit, it has large, up to 15 cm deep-veined, oval leaves arranged in opposite pairs, and bears clusters of bright red flowers. The 2-cm-large, individual flowers vary in shades of purple to scarlet. The flowering period is at its peak at the beginning of winter, and lasts until early summer, but the showy flowers are present throughout the year. It likes acidic, sandy soil, but will do well in most situations. Flaming Glorybower is relatively drought-tolerant once it has established itself, but requires deep watering in summer. It will grow to a height of 5 metres with a spread of 3 metres. This climber spreads rapidly from root suckers, which may appear through paving, but on the whole it is not an aggressive vine and climbs happily with support over trellis and shade structures. Once at the top, its branches go back down again to form a dense wall of leaves and flowers. Without support, C. splendens spreads itself flat forming a dense groundcover. Propagation is by seed, hardwood cuttings or splitting off root suckers. Easy to prune, it responds well to shaping or a very hard cut back. A tropical plant, it will be damaged if there are frosts. It is therefore not suitable for unprotected gardens outside Arriyadh, and should be sheltered from cold and hot winds."

"Riyadh","Clitoria ternatea","description","Butterfly Peas are herbaceous vines from tropical Asia. They grow dull-green, compound leaves, and dangling blue flowers with yellow centres are borne mainly from June to September. It twines rapidly to about 3 metres in height given sufficient nutrients. Ideal locations are in full to partial sun where sandy, well-drained soils are frequently irrigated. Pollination is carried out by bees, so the vine develops downy legumes with seeds that germinate readily. Members of the pea family Fabaceae or Leguminosae host bacteria Rhizobia within so-called nodules. These are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it available to the plant’s roots. Both organisms profit from this symbiotic relationship. Young plants require some initial help to start up a trellis or a fence. Butterfly Pea soon recovers from damage caused by frost and drought, and also tolerates grazing. It also does well as annual in containers, window boxes or hanging baskets. ‘Pleno’ is a cultivar with double, blue flowers. The species’ inflorescences are about 3 cm in size. Varieties such as ‘Blue Sails’ grow flowers of about 5 cm diameter. The same size but in white appears the flowering of ‘Alba’. Five petals make an interesting flower with an upright banner and two wings that enclose the boat-shaped keel at the base. Apart from its use as an ornamental climber, the Butterfly Pea is a palatable forage legume and is also used medicinally for its bioactive compounds. Maintenance is relatively low for a vine, and in Arriyadh the plant grows successfully."

"Riyadh","Cordia myxa","description","The Indian Cherry or Banbar is native to the eastern Mediterranean basin, extending as far as eastern India. It grows moderately fast to some 5 metres in height and about 6 metres in width. Exceptionally aged trees may reach up to 10 metres in height. Heart-shaped leaves are deciduous, alternate and about 20 cm long on stalks of 5 cm in length. Male and female flowers are borne on different trees. They appear in spring on panicles in white or cream-coloured. The drupes are round and some 3 cm in diameter. At first, they are green, turn yellow and become orange when fully ripened in summer. Trees start flowering at the age of 5 years. Young branches are hirsute and become glabrous later on. They show distinct leaf scars. The bark is light grey and rough. Its spreading roots prevent soil erosion. Thanks to its fleshy, sweet fruit it has been valued and introduced to tropical countries long ago. The kernel, too, is edible. Banbar has some healing properties for coughs and sore throat, and applied externally it alleviates itchy insect bites. Skin diseases may be treated with powdered bark. The foliage can be prepared as a vegetable. Banbar is found in deciduous woodlands, but also along river banks. It may become naturalises, but does not invade intact ecosystems. It tolerates drought, frost and even some shade when young. In summer, ample water should be available. Hard pruning is possible and the tree can even be coppiced. Seedlings show variable yield, and so hardwood cuttings are the preferred method for propagation."

"Riyadh","Conocarpus erectus","description","Button mangrove is a low-branching, multi-trunked, shrubby, evergreen tree, originating in tropical America and the coast of West Africa. Since the mid 1990s (CE), C. erectus can be seen everywhere in Arriyadh. Growing to a height of 20 metres with a spread of 8 metres, the tree’s crown is uniform and symmetrical and the branches upright, spreading in a vase shape. Growth is remarkably fast, up to 3 metres a year in the early stages. The tree has shiny, lanceolate, leaves and inconspicuous, small, greenish flowers, appearing in spring, followed by reddish-brown fruits. C. erectus prefers full sun, tolerates partial shade, but will not grow under taller trees. Very drought-tolerant, it will grow on compacted clay, sand, and loam, alkaline or acidic soils: salt tolerance is high. Not hardy to severe frosts, whole streets of trees have seen frost damage in one single night in Arriyadh. It is also very tolerant of air pollution. Propagation is by cuttings or layering, or partially burying straight, cut branches that root in moist ground.  Leaders must be pruned and staked for straight-trunked trees. The laterals and fine roots are weak and brittle, and not aggressive. Button mangrove has little invasive potential in Arriyadh, although a kind of monoculture has developed. It is widely planted in parking lots and streets, and is ideal as an informal or clipped hedge, windbreak, screen or specimen tree. It is good for soil stabilisation, reclamation and sand dune protection. Trees are tough and long-lived in the landscape."

"Riyadh","Conocarpus lancifolius","description","There is some confusion about the botanical name of this less common relative of C. erectus, and it has also been referred to as C. lanceolatus, C. latifolia and Anogeissus latifolius. C. lancifolius has a more open habit than C. erectus, and its leaves are longer, narrower and grey, rather than lush green. Native to coastal and riverine areas of eastern Africa and Yemen, it is to be found all over the Arabian peninsula, although it is not often seen in Arriyadh. The smell of the fluffy yellow-green flowers in spring and autumn is unpleasant to some people, especially at nighttime, in winter and when damp after rainfall. The tree’s wood is dense and suitable for charcoal: goats browse on the young leaves. It is highly salt- and drought-tolerant, and planted in afforestation projects. The C. lancifolius tree also plays a role in remediating heavy metal and oil-contaminated soil. It makes an attractive specimen tree and has all of the properties attributed to C. erectus. Silver buttonwood (C. erectus var. sericeus) is a variety that usually grows as a low-branching shrub; under ideal conditions, it will become an attractive tree up to 15 m tall with a spread of 6 metres. The evergreen leaves are oblong to lance-shaped, up to 10 cm long and covered with silky hairs, which gives a beautiful silver-grey colour which sparkles in the sun. It has great ornamental value, and deserves to be seen more often in Arriyadh."

"Riyadh","Cortaderia selloana","description","Pampas Grass is the distinctive plant of Argentina’s grasslands; in Arriyadh, it withstands hot, dry winds and is frost-tolerant. There is potential to use this plant more, but it demands space. It grows to a massive clump of 2 up to a maximum of 5 metres high, and about the same width. Leaves are pale-green and may reach 2 metres in length and are 1 cm wide. They are bent down, giving the plant a fountain-like appearance. Male and female panicles grow on different plants and the females are the more attractive ones. In late summer and autumn, silky plumes appear. When dried, they make long-lasting, ornamental elements in arrangements. In mild climates, it is evergreen, but frost may force it to become dormant. Damaged plants generally recover when cut back to the ground, but are weakened if this is practised annually. Pampas Grass tolerates full to partial sun and tolerates drought and high salinity, but requires good drainage. Any handling must be done very carefully because the serrated edges can lead to painful cuts to the skin. To keep it from injuring pedestrians, it should not be located close to pathways or seating areas. Pampas Grass makes an impressive solitary plant or may be planted in groups for screening. It readily multiplies by dividing, and propagation by sowing is also common. Cultivars have to be reproduced vegetatively. Varieties show different sizes, such as the dwarf ‘Pumila’, growing to about 1.5 metres, or another flower colour such as ‘Rosea’, with light-pink plumes."

"Riyadh","Crinum asiaticum","description","St. John Lily or Poison Bulb is an evergreen perennial from Southeast Asia. In Arriyadh, it is best in partial shade and a humid environment. Broad, dark-green foliage emerges from an enormous bulb more than 25 cm across. It should be buried half in fertile soil that is rich in humus. Numerous arching leaves reach between 1 and 1.5 metres long and some 12 cm wide, and gradually taper to the apex. If damaged by frost, they are soon replaced by new growth. Fleshy roots are easily damaged during transplanting. From spring until autumn, thick pedicels bear umbels of up to 100 large, fragrant flowers with linear white petals that made imaginative people call it Spider Lily. The tubes measure some 7 cm in diameter. Inflorescences appear several times per season and may develop capsules of 5 cm across with globose seeds. All parts are toxic if ingested. If daughter bulbs are not detached, they eventually create an imposing bunch. C. asiaticum tolerates full sun when grown in well-drained, moist soil. Some drought is tolerated by established plants on open ground. In containers, regular irrigation is essential. Potting soil should retain water without getting logged. Watering may be reduced in winter when the plant goes dormant, usually without losing its leaves. Irrigation should be resumed in early spring. Slow-releasing fertiliser should be applied at this time, while potted plants do best with water soluble nutrients every fortnight. In winter, plants may be divided, and new plants may also be achieved by sowing."

"Riyadh","Cycas revoluta","description","Fern or Sago Palm is the common name for this plant, which many believe to be a palm tree,
because of its fronds. C. revoluta belongs to a special plant family called cycads, which produce
cones instead of flowers. It is native to southern Japan. There are some excellent specimens at Kasr
Tuwaiq in the Diplomatic Quarter. It eventually grows to the proportions of a small tree, reaching
a height of 2 to 3 metres. The Cycas reaches maturity at the age of 100, but it is very slow-growing
and a specimen at this age will have a trunk of 7 metres. The evergreen, leathery, long leaves are
in a very symmetrical order at top of the stem. The plant is dioecious: the male plant develops an
impressive cone for pollen production, and the female plants bear groups of nut-like seeds that
can be used for propagation, which can also be carried out by removing the basal offsets. Cycas
prefers sandy to clayey soil with some humus content. It does not like salinity and requires adequate
irrigation and a minimum of air humidity. The Sago will grow well in the shade of trees
and is best planted to receive morning sun. Pruning is not required. C. revoluta is a very attractive
plant, because of its dark-green leaves and regular and symmetrical growth. It survives the
intense, dry heat of Arriyadh, and sometimes direct sun, remarkably well, giving a lush, tropical
impression. Attractive planting schemes can be created with Cycas as accent or specimen plants
or in groups in parks, gardens or pedestrian precincts."

"Riyadh","Cynodon dactylon","description","Bermuda Grass, sometimes called Bahama Grass (najeel in Arabic), is by far the most common
lawn grass used in Arriyadh and Saudi Arabia. It is very tolerant of heat, sun, saline water and
poorly draining soils and is also relatively free of pests and diseases, enabling it to survive where
few other grasses do. The grass blades are a grey-green colour and usually 2 to 15 cm long. The
erect flower stems grow to 30 cm tall; the seed heads are produced in a cluster of spikes. C. dactylon
has a deep root system: it creeps along the ground and roots wherever a node touches the soil,
thus forming a dense mat. It reproduces through seeds and runners. Optimum growth occurs
from 25 to 35°C. It will not tolerate full shade, e.g. under trees. Excellent turf can be achieved if
the grass is regularly irrigated, fertilised and mown. There are many fine-textured hybrid Bermudas,
the best known being the ‘Tif’ series. Stolonising is the fastest way of establishing a turf.
Sodding is very common with many turf farms in Arriyadh. Rolls of mature turf are laid down;
it is more expensive, but the effect is immediate. Bermuda Grass, when brown and dormant in
Arriyadh in winter, can be overseeded in autumn with a quick-growing winter grass, which dies
back as the heat builds up, keeping the turf green. This is a relatively intensive treatment, not
often carried out. With the habit of spreading into other areas of groundcover and gravel, its
weedy nature makes it very maintenance-intensive. It is fast growing and tough, making it useful
for sports fields."

"Riyadh","Dalbergia sissoo","description","The Indian Rosewood grows to about 15 metres high, but may even reach double this size in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, where it originates. A beautiful lush, green tree for an arid landscape, D. sissoo is not often seen or well known in Arriyadh. Its Arabic name is sarsoa. Huge specimens used to grow near the water tower in Murabba. The crown is broad but not dense. The grey bark is furrowed lengthwise. The dense roots are dominated by a long tap root. The deciduous, alternate leaves are pinnate with three or five oval leaflets. Pale yellow, sweetly scented, small flowers grow on racemes in spring. They develop to pods. In the wild, it is found along riverbanks, but will tolerate drier conditions with several months of drought. Nodules on its wide-spreading roots fix atmospheric nitrogen and gradually improve the soil, but care should be taken not to damage the roots, since suckers may develop. Soils may range from coarse sand to alluvium, with a moderate salinity. Indian Rosewood does not easily compete, especially in terms of light. Before sowing, the seeds should be soaked in water. Root suckers may also serve to grow new plants, but cuttings require additional rooting hormones to thrive. In favourable conditions, the tree grows fast and is rarely infected by pests. The graceful upward branches and light foliage make Dalbergia suitable where filtered sunlight is required, for example on lawns. It is often planted in afforestation schemes and along roads. It is a good windbreak and aids soil stabilisation."

"Riyadh","Delonix regia","description","Flamboyants, or bonsiana in Arabic, are amongst the most popular ornamental trees found in Arriyadh, where their feathery leaves are deciduous. Endemic to Madagascar, they are now distributed worldwide for their colourful blossoms that make them a beautiful attraction in late spring and early summer. Early plantings of the tree in Arriyadh during the early 1980s (CE) were not always successful, because young trees could not withstand the exposure to hot dry winds. With the gradual improvement of the microclimate and when planted close to the shelter of other trees. Spectacular, large bunches of flowers are protruded by long stamens. Bright-scarlet inflorescences appear from the age of 10 years onwards. After pollination, they develop into a large, dark-brown seed pod. The bark is fine-textured, and light grey or beige. Susceptible to frost, the tree survives a considerable period of drought and even tolerates some salinity, but such stress factors seem to decrease its life expectancy. Requires regular irrigation. During the growing season, it is essential to fertilise the tree, especially in poor, alkaline soil. It does best in fertile, well-drained ground which is not restricted by adjacent pavements, roads or buildings, since Flamboyants are surface-rooting and are liable to push up hard paving with their roots. The open, umbrella-shaped crown is made up of brittle twigs that are susceptible to strong winds. For its extraordinary floral performance, this tree deserves to be treated as a highlight in large gardens and parks."

"Riyadh","Millettia pinnata","description","Millettia pinnata (previously named Derris indica), commonly called Indian Beech, is a shrub or tree of about 8 metres height, while it may reach 25 metres in its homelands from India to Thailand. It has been planted in many places in Arriyadh. The gnarled, fissured trunk bears a wide-spreading crown with weeping branches. Young foliage is reddish at first, turning dark-green with age. Leaves are dropped in early spring, but are replaced a few weeks later. They are arranged alternately, pinnate and attract the eye with their shiny surface. Strongly fragrant flowers are borne on drooping racemes. They appear in late spring and summer, either in white or pink with a purple throat, and are followed by leathery, brown pods. Indian Beeches are absolutely resistant to salinity and high alkalinity, since they occur naturally along seashores together with mangroves, where they are used to water-logging. They also tolerate drought, together with shade and full sun. Seedlings are not as tough, but once grown up, they also tolerate some frost and desert heat. This tree seems to adapt to any condition, but looks best if planted in deep, well-drained soil that retains some moisture or receives frequent irrigation. The tree propagates readily by its bean-like seeds and plenty of root suckers. Pruning is required to lead the Indian Beech from a shrub into a tree. It rejuvenates when pollarded or even coppiced. It is an ornamental tree for gardens, parks and avenues, where it should be lined up at intervals of about 8 metres."

"Riyadh","Dodonaea viscosa","description","This medium to tall shrub occurs with many foliage variations throughout the tropics and is also widespread in southwestern Saudi Arabia, where it is often seen on the edge of wadis as an erect shrub with its bright foliage. Its Arabic name is shath. Not grazed by animals, its leaves have medicinal properties for treating rheumatism and wounds. The lush green creates an accent in an arid landscape, as a contrast to grey-leaved plants. The bronze-purple leafed variety ‘Purpurea’ from Australia is also attractive with an intense, rich colour in winter. Unfortunately, it can be less hardy to frost in Arriyadh than the green-leafed species. The insignificant, small flowers without petals are borne in racemes after spring rains, and also throughout the year. The pollen has a strong odour at a close distance. Pinkish fruits are attractive in the autumn. Dodonea is a versatile shrub that is often irregular in shape. It can, however, be planted in formal gardens and clipped as a hedge or into geometrical shapes. At the same time, as a xerophyte, it is also drought-resistant and at home in a desert situation, where it evokes the atmosphere of a wadi bed, when planted in run-off channels. Best in full sun, it will tolerate shade, but it does have the disadvantage that its greedy lateral and deep roots will take the water from other plants nearby. Overwatering should be avoided."

"Riyadh","Duvernoia adhatodoides","description","The Pistol Bush is a shrub of 3 metres in height found in the undergrowth of coastal forests in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. It provides a good background shrub in Arriyadh, preferably in a sheltered environment. It grows an oval or round shape, but may be trained as a standard, revealing a rough, dark-brown bark. Large, evergreen leaves are shiny on top and have a lush impact. Flowering begins in February and may last until August. The conspicuous flowers appear on upright spikes and are white with purple lines. When pollinated by bees they develop into 3 × 1 cm capsules that burst open with a loud crack to release ripe seeds. This procedure made the Pistol Bush earn its common name. Both the vivid growth and its prolonged flowering period make this shrub a decorative specimen in small gardens and public parks. It may grow as a dense screen, flowering hedge or act as background planting. The large leaves do not take shearing, but pruning is possible at any time of the year. Light frosts are tolerated, but plants should not be exposed to drying winds. Owing to its forest origins, it responds to composted soil and partial sun with healthy growth. It responds well to fertiliser and does best with frequent irrigation in summer. Propagation is possible from both seeds and cuttings. Seedlings often appear in mulch and can be potted to multiply the shrub. It does not become invasive in desert climates, and is generally free of pests and diseases."

"Riyadh","Echinops hussoni","description","Echinops hussoni, or Globe Thistle, has a wide range of habitats. It is widespread in dry wadi beds in the Arriyadh region, whereby its original climatic zone is more Mediterranean and subtropical. It is known in Arabic as shidq aljamal. The Globe Thistle is a prickly, perennial herb, named after its attractive, spherically shaped, pale-blue flowers. It grows to a height of 60 cm. The stems and leaves are silver grey-green, soft, but with spiny tips and woolly underneath. The plant’s leaves form a star on the ground from which the flower stalk emerges, usually during the early summer, bearing a globe covered with tiny flowers between the spines. The blooms are still attractive, even when dry after flowering. The blue globes attract many butterflies and other insects. The fleshy roots are quite deep. E. hussoni prefers poor, sandy or rocky soil that is well drained. Tolerance to salinity is low, but otherwise the plant is well adapted to harsh, desert conditions. It can be propagated by seed, and it self-seeds easily. An attractive plant for massed planting or groundcover, as well as in rock or steppe gardens, this perennial is very useful for planting in open country as a coloniser, a slope stabiliser or on rocky hillsides. These thistles do not need irrigation once established, and maintenance is also very low."

"Riyadh","Eucalyptus camaldulensis","description","The Red Gum tree, known in Arabic as keenah or kafur, is the most common Eucalyptus to be seen in the Arriyadh region. Native to Australia, which claims over 500 species of the genus, it has been introduced into many arid countries throughout the world, where they now have the reputation of being invasive, too large and too greedy. Massive with a weeping habit and open crown, it grows very rapidly to a height of 30 metres. Its familiar smooth bark is white and grey, which, when shed in long strips, exposes a red colour underneath. Lanceolate, straight and curved leaves with a fragrant sap are a matt, blue-green; yellowish-white flowers occur in early summer and the seed pods are pea-sized nutlets. E. camaldulensis requires full sun, and although drought tolerant, it will do better with periodic deep watering. It is very tolerant of all soils, even those waterlogged and with a high pH and salinity, but is susceptible to chlorosis. Propagation is by seed. Frost-tolerant, the tree is valuable in giving shade, but it is too huge for garden planting. It plays an important role as a wind break, in reafforestation, stabilising watercourses, and is suitable for roadside planting and parks. E. camaldulensis has a habit of dropping large boughs without warning – a form of self-pruning, but a major problem in urban areas. It is a high-maintenance tree, producing a large amount of leaf, bark and seed litter; its roots are deep, spreading and very aggressive. Young trees must be well-staked and pruned to create a strong vertical trunk."

"Riyadh","Eucalyptus globulus","description","The Blue Gum, known in Arabic as keenah or kafur, is one of the most extensively planted trees in its native country of Australia. It typically grows to 30 metres and more, and is similar in habit to E. camaldulensis with its peeling bark. When young, the leaves are broad, in opposite pairs and covered with a blue-grey bloom. The mature leaves are then narrow, curved and dark green, up to 20 cm in length. Cream-coloured flowers produce nectar yielding a typically flavoured honey. The roundish fruits bear many small seeds, shed through the top of the capsule. Like all eucalypts, it has deep-spreading roots and grows rapidly, adapting to the conditions in of all arid regions. E. globulus is the most cultivated plantation tree in Australia, widely used as pulpwood and for fuel. The Blue Gum was often planted as a street tree in the past, but it is now regarded as unsuitable, owing to its mature size and high maintenance requirement. Some ecologists consider it to be an invasive species, as well as a fire hazard. Nevertheless, it is one of several eucalypts suitable for planting in the Arriyadh region as a wind break, in reafforestation, and stabilising slopes and watercourses. Given space, it is suitable as a park tree. Other eucalypts worth mentioning are E. citriodora (Lemon-Scented Gum), a graceful, frost-tender tree, often seen in Kuwait, and E. microtheca (Coolibah), a widely distributed eucalypt, proven in Kuwait and very frost-hardy."

"Riyadh","Eucalyptus gomphocephala","description","Eucalyptus gomphocephala is a tall, wide-girthed, evergreen tree with its origins on the southwestern coast of Australia, where it reaches heights from 10 to 40 metres depending on location, growing on hilly terrain on limestone overlain by sand. Known there as Tuart, it has been cultivated in many arid countries. It has a dense crown with large spreading, nearly upright branches. The fibrous, fissured bark is light grey, and does not shed like other gum trees. Leaves are narrowly lanceolate, up to 17 cm long and slightly curved, with a shiny grey-green colour. This species has white flowers in summer and autumn, and the seed capsules remain on trees for a year or more. E. gomphocephala tolerates drought, strong winds and alkaline, moderately saline soils. It will grow on less fertile soils than E. camaldulensis, but is not tolerant of waterlogging. Hardy only to –6°C, it produces very dense, durable wood, which is termite-resistant and used for construction purposes. It is also an excellent honey producer. It is easily propagated from seed. Extremely useful as a windbreak and in a shelterbelt, although sensitive to fire, it has high wildlife value. It has been widely planted as a shade-giving tree and roadside tree, but as with other large Eucalyptus trees it is not recommended for this in Arriyadh. It is susceptible to the eucalypt borer and some fungi, especially on dry sites. Its roots will compete with adjacent plants and will invade water pipes and tanks, as well as lifting pavements."

"Riyadh","Euphorbia tirucalli","description","The Pencil Bush may be found growing wild in Madagascar and southeastern Africa, where it sometimes forms large trees of 10 to 15 metres in height. In cultivation and especially in Arriyadh, it is a multi-branched shrub with a noteworthy shape and some 4 metres in height. Its cylindrical branches are dull green and measure about 8 mm in diameter, just like a common pencil. They give this fast-growing plant the appearance of a giant round brush. Mature bark turns grey and occasionally shows harmless swellings and black bands. The linear foliage is short-lived and leaves small dents that give a pattern to the branches. In autumn, clusters of tiny yellow flowers appear without much visual impact. Subsequent capsules measure 12 mm across and dehisce while still on the plant. Seeds, but also cuttings, are used to propagate the plant. Cuttings’ loss of sap should first staunch in water and dry for a few days thereafter. Any injury immediately releases latex that cause blisters on the skin and is poisonous if ingested. On the other hand, it is used as an antidote for snake bites. Plants should not grow next to a pond, since they are toxic to fish. Pencil Bushes tolerate some salinity, drought and, surprisingly, they tolerate poor drainage better than other succulent shrubs. However, supplemental irrigation should be omitted in autumn and ceased in winter in order to achieve healthy plants. The plant looks best amongst boulders in rock gardens or grouped on embankments along roads, where it tolerates full sun."

"Riyadh","Ficus altissima","description","The Council Tree, also known as Lofty Fig, is a large-leaved, fast-growing tree with its origins in India. In Arriyadh, it has become a very common and successful tree, having been planted in major projects in the city, mostly on roadsides and squares. Tall, up to 20 metres in height, it has a wide, spreading crown and, in time, develops drooping, aerial roots. Trees sometimes develop multiple trunks. Its simple, glabrous and elliptical leaves measure up to 25 cm in length and have pronounced white veins, making it distinguishable from other large-leaved Ficus trees. The fruits are similar to those of the edible fig, but more rounded in shape, and are orange-coloured when ripe. The bark is typically a light silver grey and is an attractive contrast to the leaves in the shade. F. altissima requires deep fertile soils, but grows well in sandy soil and tolerates both salinity and drought; however, regular irrigation is a necessity. Propagation is by softwood cuttings, air-layering on branches or by seed. It is not particularly prone to pests, but can appear cholorotic at times. F. altissima lends a lush, tropical appearance to a planting scheme, but unfortunately is not frost-tolerant. Providing excellent shade from Arriyadh’s relentless sun, it tends to shade out plants growing beneath. It is a magnificent tree as a specimen in a park, and is also suitable for large gardens. Only moderate maintenance is required."

"Riyadh","Ficus benghalensis","description","The Banyan is a large and fast-growing tree originating in northwest India in the foothills of the Himalayas. As an epiphyte, it starts life when the seeds germinate in crevices between the branches of the host tree. Often seen in parks in Arriyadh, it develops into a majestic tree, given sufficient space. It will reach a height of up to 30 metres and as much as 18 metres in width with a short, stout trunk with smooth, grey bark. In maturity, it typically produces aerial roots from its outstretched heavy limbs, which hang downwards from the branches in a dense network and ultimately help to support the main trunk. Rooting in new ground, the tree then takes on a new lease of life. This development, while common in India, is not observed in Arriyadh. The large, ovate and obtuse leaves are a glabrous dark green; newly sprouted leaves are a startling red. Older leaves fall regularly after the new ones have grown, so that all leaves are gradually replaced throughout the year. Fruits are fig-like and red when ripe, and are eaten by bats. The roots run flat below the surface and are particularly extensive. F. benghalensis prefers a deep fertile soil, but will grow on sandy soils with regular irrigation in full sun. Trees have medium drought and salinity tolerance, and are also quite hardy to frosts. Propagation is by softwood cuttings and air-layering on branches. The Banyan tree makes an excellent specimen tree in parks and public squares. Leaf litter is a maintenance item and good pruning is required to keep the tree in shape."

"Riyadh","Ficus carica","description","The common Fig, or teen in Arabic, is a small, deciduous tree, native to the Mediterranean and often seen in Arriyadh growing on farms, in gardens and as escapees from cultivation. A fairly fast-growing tree, up to 9 metres high with a 3-metre spread, it has a short, heavy trunk with smooth, silvery bark and spreading branches. The leaves are large and rough-textured with three to five lobes. Depending on the variety, of which there are many, the sweet, pear-shaped, edible fruits can be yellow, green, purple or black in colour when ripe. Plants require protection from the wind, full sun to partial shade, and will endure long dry periods, but for fruiting and general appearance, deep watering every month during the summer, with less water in winter, is necessary. They grow well in poor soils, but need good drainage and are not very tolerant of salty or alkaline soils. Generally frost-tolerant, a tree will often lose its leaves in winter. However, a hard freeze can result in dieback of the branches. Propagation is by cuttings, air-layering and root suckering. Apart from its use as a cultivated fruit tree, F. carica is a tree with bold foliage and an irregular trunk, which also has ornamental value for a garden. It makes a good background plant or screen in a park and is attractive in its leafless state, because of the picturesque character of its branches. It is also suitable for training on a wall and for planting in containers. Pruning is required to maintain the canopy and improve fruit production."

"Riyadh","Ficus religiosa","description","The Peepul Tree, known in Arabic as lissan al asfour, is native to the Indian sub-continent and southeast Asia. It is a very large, erect and elegant semi-deciduous tree, which reaches a height of 20 metres in Arriyadh with a spread of up to 10 metres. Its trunk can have great proportions, sometimes up to 3 metres in diameter. The gracefully hanging leaves are a distinctive, dark green, attractively veined, with a long, pointed tip, something like the beak of a bird, hence its Arabic name. They are up to 15 cm long and ovate to 12 cm. New leaf growth is pinkish in colour. Greenish, insignificant flowers are borne in spring. The fruits are sessile figs turning purple when ripe. F. religiosa prefers a sunny position and a deep, fertile, mildly alkaline soil. With its shallow roots, it often forms above-ground buttress roots at maturity and, depending on the location, the tree’s roots therefore may become a nuisance, especially if there is insufficient space and when paving is buckled. The tree requires regular irrigation, but will not tolerate waterlogging and it is only moderately tolerant to salinity and hard frosts. Propagation is by seed, hardwood cuttings or simple layering. It is occasionally prone to red spider mites. Pruning will help to keep its shape, but care must be taken not to spoil its natural habit. This majestic tree can be used as a specimen tree in parks and large gardens. It provides good shade along pathways and can be planted in urban open spaces, where there is room, and wide road medians."

Cultivars often show double flowers and even variegated foliage. Berries contain seeds that are embedded in an orange pulp. Established plants withstand full sun if the water supply is excellent. They generally do better with some afternoon shade without reducing the floral splendour. If planted in the ground, the soil must be enriched with peat or compost. As heavy feeders, they should receive frequent fertilisation in early spring, early summer and early autumn with an acid type. Irrigation must be regular and thorough, with the lowest possible salt content. Gardenias are prone to overwatering, both in poor-draining soil and in containers. Apart from this sensitivity, they do well in pots and troughs, since they grow quite slowly to become a dense bush and are not harmed if they become rootbound. Pruning can be done in autumn, but is rarely necessary to shape these compact bushes. Gardenias are also susceptible to a black mould which forms on the leaves, as well as nematodes, but the plants’ beauty is worth the effort to replace infested soil. G. augusta is an ideal shrub only for a small-sized garden without exposure to full sun or strong winds. It is not always successful in Arriyadh."

"Riyadh","Grevillea robusta","description","The Silk Oak is a strong, enduring tree that reaches a maximum height of 50 metres. However, such growth can be expected only in its native country, Australia. Although it grows quite fast, it will usually not exceed 13 metres, especially in Arriyadh. The tree has a conical, upright form. Fern-like, lacy leaves are shiny green on top and silvery below, while the showy orange flowers are borne in large clusters on the branches, usually when the tree is in a semi-deciduous state after the winter. Silk Oaks are considered evergreen, but foliage may be shed owing to cold, or when the new leaves appear. It will tolerate a wide variety of soils, but these should be well drained. Waterlogging and alkaline desert soils limit the speed of growth and cause iron chlorosis. The wood is brittle and wind exposure may cause branches to die back or break off. Propagation is by seed or cuttings. G. robusta is a background tree for use in parks and in public squares. A mature tree makes a picturesque silhouette against the sky. Heavy pruning is possible, but may spoil the columnar or pyramidal shape. It has toxic qualities. Grevilleas may sometimes cause painful skin irritation. Regular irrigation is necessary at first, but a mature tree is generally drought-resistant and requires a deep soaking every month or so. Heavy leaf litter in spring necessitates a lot of tidying up from lawns and paving, although it can be left as mulch on the soil. This tree is rarely seen in Arriyadh, although it has potential for planting in protected situations."

"Riyadh","Ipomoea pes-caprae","description","From the West Indies, the Beach Morning Glory began to spread, and is now found growing on beaches and dunes in subtropical and tropical climates. It is well established in Arriyadh. It covers the soil sparsely with long stems that root at the nodes to fix itself on the ground. This trait is valued in controlling erosion. Roots may reach 3 metres deep and one plant can cover an area of 30 metres across while being less than 10 cm high. To resist heat and strong winds the evergreen leaves are stiff, almost succulent, and they are lobed like the imprint of a goat’s hoof. Its species’ name, pes-caprae, means foot of a goat. Cold winters may cause it to go dormant and shed its foliage. The funnel-shaped, lilac flowers are very attractive and are borne in late spring until autumn. They measure about 5 cm in diameter and open in the morning, hence their vernacular name Morning Glory. Another common name is Railroad Vine, referring to its very fast growth that occasionally needs to be controlled. Adverse conditions such as high salinity, torrid sun and prolonged drought are tolerated by established plants. Frost will cause dieback and plants often have bare patches where damage has been caused. Although the plant can be grown from seed, it is usually started from cuttings. Beach Morning Glories are ideal plants in low-maintenance gardens with poor soil. Since they do not cover the soil densely, weeds may penetrate the area, so that mulching is required on fertile ground."

"Riyadh","Iresine herbstii","description","The Bloodleaf, picturesquely named after the colour of its leaves, is a surprisingly robust perennial herb, native to Brazil, and grows well in Arriyadh, where it is often seen as a groundcover in parks. This is an evergreen, herbaceous plant, growing to about 1 m tall and wide. It has oval, sometimes almost circular, leaves, 2 to 6 cm long, pointed at the tip, with pronounced light red veins. Bloodleaf is planted for its varieties, which can have startling colours and markings, ranging from purple to bright reds, magenta and orange. There are also some green varieties. The small, woolly, mostly white flowers are usually inconspicuous. Good in bright sunlight, they are also attractive in light shade. I. herbstii is damaged by temperatures below freezing, and a sheltered spot is beneficial. The spectacular show of foliage colour is shown throughout the season. Plants prefer fertile soil, but will also grow in sandy soils with good drainage as long as they are not saline. They require regular and copious watering. Easily propagated by cuttings, which root quickly in water, plants can suffer from aphids. Bloodleaf is a highly ornamental plant, popular for its colour and as a groundcover and border plant. It is also often seen as a pot plant. Maintenance requirements are low, but weeding between plants and edge trimming may be necessary."

"Riyadh","Ixora chinensis","description","This round shrub originates from the tropical and subtropical forests from Malaya to China. It grows moderately fast to about 1.5 metres in height. The shiny, dark-green foliage is attractive and takes Arriyadh’s climate relatively well in a protected garden environment. The oval leaves may reach 15 cm in length. The Flame of the Woods bears spherical cymes of 12 cm diameter, consisting of scarlet florets. They seem to glow when the shrub is located beneath trees that cast light shade. Types with red, orange and yellow flowers may also be found in cultivation. The peak of floral display is in summer, but inflorescences appear all year round. Flowers are followed by hard berries. Some cultivars remain compact dwarf types, and are therefore ideal plants for containers. The plant tolerates some salinity and brief periods of drought, but performs best in nutritious, well-drained soil which is moist and acidic. Alkaline soil results in iron deficiency, as indicated by yellow leaves. Fertilisers should be applied frequently, especially during the flowering period. It also responds well to compost and manure. Light requirements range from partial shade to full sun. The shrub can be grown as a flowering hedge and takes pruning at any time of the year. It looks best grouped in mixed borders with some shade in the afternoon. Adverse conditions ease infestations by scale insects and nematodes. It may be propagated in summer by softwood cuttings. The plants require initial protection against transpiration."

"Riyadh","Ixora coccinea","description","The Jungle Flame is an evergreen shrub native to India and Sri Lanka. Frost-sensitive in Arriyadh, it has become a popular garden shrub in recent years. Its shiny, leathery leaves measure 5 to 10 cm long and 3 to 5 cm across. Young foliage sprouts tinted in bronze. Bright red flowers appear in clusters of 10 cm diameter and attract butterflies. At first, the outer flowers open while the inner ones follow later on. Various cultivars are available with flower colours in pink, orange, yellow or white. Flowering begins in late spring, but flowers appear sporadically all year round. Other varieties grow compact and seem to be hybrids with the Flame of the Woods (Ixora chinensis). It is less suitable for desert climates than its Chinese cousin, but takes more shade. In its native environment, this shrub reaches a height of 6 metres, but in Arriyadh it grows to only about half that size. Softwood cuttings root best at the end of summer, encouraged by some rooting hormone. Initially, they should be pinched to achieve regular branching. If grown in pots, the Jungle Flame tends to shed flowers, especially if it is moved. It appreciates light, but does not tolerate full sun if this is associated with harsh conditions such as drought and wind. The soil should be well drained, acidic and nutrient-rich with plenty of compost. Frequent deep irrigation is essential to establish the plants. The plants look great if planted in groups or as a flowering hedge. Scale sometimes affects this shrub, but otherwise it tends to be disease-free."

"Riyadh","Jacaranda mimosifolia","description","Native to tropical South America, this deciduous tree is an eye-catcher in full flower with large panicles of lilac or pale blue. These appear in spring before the foliage fully forms. Flowers may appear again in autumn, but less obviously, because of the dense bipinnate leaves. They resemble those of some acacias – hence its species’ name mimosifolia – but may immediately be distinguished for their opposite phyllotaxy. Jacaranda comes from the vernacular Brazilian name. They grow fast to a height of about 10 metres and equivalent width in sunny positions when the soil is fertile and frequently watered. The soil should contain compost and be fast-draining. Unfavourable conditions such as compacted soil or continual drought will lead to dead branches. The shallow-growing roots must not be damaged. Jacaranda is not often seen in Arriyadh; it is not particularly well suited to the climate and its growth often comes to a standstill. In Arriyadh’s coldest regions, the Jacaranda’s twigs may freeze, but trees soon recover just as if they had been pruned. The tree can be cut back in late winter. Large, flat, red-brown fruits somehow resemble ravioli and reveal seeds that easily germinate if watered for 24 hours before sowing. Jacarandas may be grown in pots for their attractive fern-like leaves, but flowers will not appear on such plants. Mature trees are flat-topped and their lacy foliage creates light summer shade. With summer humidity, they make specimens for pedestrian areas. In Arriyadh, unfortunately, they are not very successful."

"Riyadh","Jasminum sambac","description","Centuries ago, merchants brought the Arabian Jasmine from its native habitat in southern Asia along trading routes westwards. This is a popular shrub in Arriyadh, which somehow never looks its best. The evergreen leaves are leathery, glossy and grouped in twos or threes along the twining stems. They differ from those of other species by being entire. In summer, clusters of white, tubular flowers are borne to emit the outstanding fragrance that jasmines are known for. In other seasons, flowering is sporadic. Full or partial sun is required to produce abundant inflorescences. A fertile, well-drained soil allows vital growth so that this climber will stand some drought when established. However, it appreciates frequent irrigation and generally remains free from pests and diseases. General purpose fertilisers should be applied in two split doses during spring to support new growth first and development of flower buds later on. Transplanting is best done in autumn. Low temperatures are no problem, but Arabian Jasmines should not be exposed to prolonged frosts. They need to be trained along a support such as a trellis or a pergola reaching about 3 metres in height. Plants will also grow in containers and tolerate pruning at any time to form a shrub, for instance, but not a climber. It may also blanket the ground with its attractive dark-green foliage. Cuttings and sowing are handy methods of propagation. In China, the dried flowers are used to make the famous jasmine tea and they may also be processed to yield perfume."

"Riyadh","Jasminum polyanthum","description","In forests of subtropical China, the Pink Jasmine may be found growing wild as a vigorous climber up to 6 metres high. The leaves are compound with five or seven leaflets from which the terminal one is the largest. They usually last during winter, but may shed in cold winters without any damage to the twining stems as long as freezing is mild and brief. A large number of pink buds are borne in late winter to turn into white, star-shaped flowers 2 cm across. A pleasant, sweet scent is emitted during flowering in spring. Flowers also appear less profusely in summer and autumn. The plant is a source of aromatic oil that may be extracted to produce perfume. Pollination results in dark-blue berries. Established plants take full sun and tolerate some drought. However, flowers are also produced in abundance where plants thrive in the partial shade of palm groves. They do well in pots indoors or in containers with excellent drainage. A lush appearance is achieved in fertile soil either acidic or alkaline with supplemental irrigation in summer. Pruning in winter does not affect the flowers, since they grow in terminal clusters on new growth. Pink Jasmines require support such as a fence or, if grown in front of a wall, some sort of trellis is needed. Semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer root easily and plants already flower when young. Other methods are layering and sowing seeds that have been cleaned and dried first. The plant is so easy to grow that it has become invasive in some regions with favourable climate."

"Riyadh","Jatropha integerrima","description","Native to Cuba, this tall, dense, rounded evergreen shrub, commonly known as Peregrina, grows up to 3 metres high with an equal spread, and when mature will be almost like a tree with several slender trunks. It has been quite successful in Arriyadh in recent years, in both parks and gardens, as well as in urban situations. The glossy, oval leaves are about 10 cm long, medium-green and velvety on the upper surface. Bright scarlet, five-petalled, star-shaped flowers with yellow stamens bloom in clusters in summer. J. integerrima does best in full sun in frost-free locations, but will tolerate partial shade. In very cold winters in Arriyadh, it may become semi-deciduous, but the main stems are hardy. It requires regular irrigation, especially in late spring and summer, but can be classed as a drought-tolerant plant, once established. Tolerant of a wide variety of poor and dry soils, as long as these are well draining, the shrub is not tolerant of salinity. It flowers on the current year’s growth, so it can be pruned at any time of the year. All parts of the plant contain toxic substances. Propagation is from cuttings taken in spring. A slow-release fertiliser, applied two to four times a year, will improve the plant’s appearance. J. integerrima is a spectacular shrub in flower and can be used as an accent or in a shrub border. It is also a fine container plant for patios. Suitable for planting in buffer strips such as road medians and in urban landscapes squares, some protection is necessary against hot desiccating winds."

"Riyadh","Kalanchoë blossfeldiana","description","While most succulents are grown for their remarkable foliage, thickened stems or spectacular thorns, this succulent attracts attention with its brightly coloured flowers. Native to Madagascar, Flaming Katies grow a compact, round shape to about 40 cm high. Their fleshy, deep-green leaves are round or oval with scalloped edges. Clusters of small tubular flowers show up in the colours white, yellow, orange, red, pink or purple. They appear in winter for weeks. The Flaming Katy may grow as a tough indoor plant or as a highly ornamental bedding plant. The soil should be well drained. The most frequent problems for pot-grown Kalanchoes are overwatering and applying cold water that shocks the roots. During dry periods with insufficient watering, the leaves begin to turn yellow and shrivel up before they are dropped. This starts from the bottom progressing upwards, until the branches bear remnants of foliage that will not become attractive again. Cutting back may result in rejuvenating growth, but it is more appropriate to replace the entire planting. After flowering, the flower stalks should be cut off to give a neat appearance and to induce the production of new buds. A disadvantage is the brittle leaves and branches. They are easily damaged, which means that the Flaming Katy should be located carefully. In Arriyadh’s climate, it does best if not exposed to full sun, especially in the afternoon. It should be used to bring its splendid colours into shady areas. It is very easy to multiply Flaming Katy by cuttings in spring or autumn."

"Riyadh","Kalanchoë daigremontiana","description","The Devil’s Backbone originates from southwest Madagascar, where the climate is quite similar to the dry, hot and rocky conditions in Arriyadh. It makes a gnarled round bush of about 1 metres in height. This succulent grows green stems sparsely aligned with opposite, fleshy leaves that produce tiny plantlets along the edges. These pseudo-bulbils appear in summer and root even before touching the ground. This may result in an abundant number of new plants and so this Kalanchoe has earned the other common name Maternity Plant. The foliage is pale-green freckled in red, and may bend upwards in dry conditions. Older plants show clusters of bright orange, tubular flowers at the beginning of summer. In autumn, the floral stems should be cut back and vigorous growth is achieved after pruning the plant back to the ground. The soil must be sandy to ensure excellent drainage. Established plants tolerate full sun and heat, but should be watered frequently. Partially sunny locations are also eligible, especially with some shade in the afternoon. While the Devil’s Backbone is resilient to most desert conditions, it will be killed by frost and overwatering. It makes an ideal specimen in rock gardens and can be grown in pots as a house plant or in containers to embellish a terrace or courtyard. They should be pinched occasionally to obtain lateral branching and a more compact growth. Maintenance requirements are low in appropriate locations. A serious hazard is the plant’s toxicity if ingested by livestock."

"Riyadh","Lagerstroemia indica","description","Native to China, the Crape Myrtle is a beautiful, tall shrub or small tree growing up to 5 m high and wide, which makes a lovely accent in a garden. It is not very common in Riyadh, because not all of its growing conditions can be fulfilled. However, choice specimens can be seen in Olaya. Looking best with multi-trunks, L. indica has dark green, oval leaves up to 5 cm long (light green with a copper tone in spring, turning brilliant orange or red in autumn) and clusters of delicate, crinkly-petaled flowers. There are many cultivars with a wide range of colours from brilliant red to pink, purple, lavender and white. One of its most attractive attributes is the attractive, smooth grey/brown trunk and branch structure, appearing to be polished in winter, the bark of which peels off to reveal a pinkish inner bark. The tree requires sun and heat to bloom well, with some wind protection and though quite drought resistant, regular irrigation and deep watering in summer are appreciated. The Crape Myrtle prefers well-drained, fertile, sandy soils, but is not tolerant of alkaline or saline soil. It will tolerate frost in Riyadh. Propagation is usually by seed. A slow release fertilizer, rich in nitrogen and potassium, can be applied 2 to 3 times per year. Susceptible to mildew and attacks by aphids and cochineals, systemic fungicides and insecticides will prevent these, when applied in spring. Prone also to leaf burn and chlorosis, due to irrigation with saline and alkaline water, the soil must be leached and treated with iron. Requiring only low maintenance and light pruning to encourage flowering, this tree is excellent on patios, in containers, and close to doorways."

"Riyadh","Lampranthus aureus","description","This sturdy plant originates from the Western Cape region, South Africa. Gold Ice Plants are small shrubs with succulent leaves arranged in pairs. In ideal conditions, they can grow up to 50 cm high, but they usually form low mats of some 15 cm. The foliage is dark green, but turns pale bluish-green in drought and may reach 5 cm in length. During its flowering period, the entire plant is covered with bright-orange, daisy-like flowers borne in stalked clusters or single, each measuring some 5 cm across. They close at night and will not open unless bright sunlight induces them to do so. Accordingly, they are also known as Midday Plants or Municipal Workers, because the inflorescences open at 9 in the morning and close at 5 in the afternoon. Flowers appear from late spring until early autumn, after pollination by insects, they are followed by capsules. An adaptation to desert conditions is a mechanism that seeds are not released from the capsules before it rains, even if this takes several months. Seeds are produced in abundance and are an easy method for multiplying the plants. Another method of propagation is to take cuttings in autumn. The plant grows well in sand or loam, but does not tolerate waterlogging. By virtue of the leaves’ capacity to store water, established plants do well with little supplemental irrigation. Watering may be done with medium levels of salt. Gold Ice Plants are suitable for large groundcover areas and containers. In Arriyadh, they withstand the harsh conditions of hot sun and winter cold very well."

"Riyadh","Lampranthus glaucus","description","The Yellow Vygie is one of more than 220 species of this genus, which makes it the largest group within the ice plant family (Aizoaceae). Glaucus is the Greek word for blue, and refers to the colour of the three-angled leaves that protect this perennial from glaring sun. The plant grows fairly quickly to build a dense cushion up to 60 cm in height, but usually much lower, forming mats of some 20 cm. Large, sulphur-yellow flowers cover the plant in spring. If pollinated by insects, the flowers develop into woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It grows in full sun to partial shade, tolerates heat but also survives frosts up to –10°C. Tolerating a considerable period of drought makes the Yellow Vygie interesting for xeriscape (water-wise) uses. Frequent watering is appreciated, but the plant may quickly be overwatered in heavy soils. Propagation is simple by cuttings, but the surface must callous before planting. The plants also grow well from seeds. Capsules swell up after sufficient rain only to release seeds when there is a sufficient amount of water to ensure successful germination. This robust plant gives a showy display without much effort. It is an ideal groundcover or group plant for low-maintenance gardens, parks and in containers. Infestations are rare, but weak plants may be attacked by scale, which requires treatment with a systemic pesticide. Some compost is welcome, although the plants are used to poor and alkaline soil conditions."

"Riyadh","Lantana camara","description","Lantana is indigenous to Mexico and Central America. It is a medium-sized, evergreen shrub reaching a height of 150 cm. The thin branches and dark-green, oval leaves are roughly haired. The inflorescence is composed of numerous, little flowers on many heads, which vary in colour from pink and yellow to red and orange. The leaves and flowers, which bloom throughout the year, have a strong fragrance. After flowering, green berries appear, which ripen to black. The entire plant is poisonous, especially the fruits. Lantanas can withstand very high temperatures and sun, but grow better with humidity. It is moderately tolerant of salinity and will grow on any soil type. Different cultivars are available such as L. c. ‘Fabiola’, flowering yellow-red-pink, L. c. ‘Nana’ flowers in yellow-orange-red on the same head and L. c. ‘Radiation’ flowers orange-red. L. camara is the garden relative of Lantana horrida, which is much more drought-tolerant, but even less frost-tolerant. Lantanas are best propagated by cuttings. They are versatile shrubs for arid regions forming natural screens, clipped hedges or splashes of colour. It is a popular shrub in urban areas, public open spaces and park planting. It is useful as low underplanting and in extensive landscapes; it will almost become naturalised. It is now quite wild in certain areas of the Diplomatic Quarter. Relatively low maintenance is required, and a dense, attractive shape is achieved by regular pruning. Occasional deep watering and feeding will also improve its appearance."

"Riyadh","Lantana montevidensis","description","The Trailing Lantana is native to tropical South America, Uruguay and Brazil, and is a vigorous, spreading sub-shrub or shrub growing only 30 cm high, but spreading up to 2 metres. It has been quite successful in Arriyadh. Semi-evergreen foliage is dark green and the profuse flowers on many heads are a bright violet-blue, covering the plant almost completely throughout the year and giving a bold splash of colour, especially in winter. This Lantana likes light, well-drained soil with regular irrigation and has medium tolerance to salinity. It develops well in sunny locations, but partial shade is also possible. Slightly sensitive to frost, it will recover again in spring. Lantana montevidensis can be propagated by seeds and with cuttings. Like other Lantanas, the plant is poisonous to livestock. Trailing Lantana is impressive as a ground cover and in steppe or rock gardens. It can be used for the tops of walls, because it will cascade down the wall and cover it with its flowers. Urban areas, public open space, park plantings and pedestrian precincts are preferred areas for using this Lantana as ground cover. Containers can be planted with it too. Relatively high maintenance is necessary; the plants have the disadvantage of dying back at their centre, so that mass planting has to be renewed every so often. Trimming of the tops once a year will encourage dense growth and rich flowering. Plants should be fertilised up to twice a year and may need to be sprayed against whiteflies."

"Riyadh","Latania loddigesii","description","The Blue Latan Palm is a striking fan palm adapted to the seasonally dry climate of its native Mauritius, where it grows on cliffs and in canyons. This is a palm tree with potential for greater use in Arriyadh, where to date it has been seen only in private gardens. Slow-growing, L. loddigesii reaches a height of 10 metres and has coarse-textured, spirally arranged leaf blades up to 2 metres in diameter, held erect on long petioles. A white down on the surface of the leaves lends the tree a silvery appearance. The trunk has a thick, swollen base. Its cream-coloured flowers on stalks up to 1.8 metres long are not very showy, and the oval fruits up to 12 cm in size are green-brown. Blue Latan palms require full sun to partial shade. They prefer fertile soils but tolerate clayey, sandy and loam soils, which are slightly alkaline and well drained; drought tolerance is high, salt tolerance is moderate. This palm requires regular irrigation until established and deep watering in summer. Propagated by seed, it is sensitive to pests and diseases, and is particularly susceptible to lethal yellowing disease. The pruning requirement is very low, but fruit and leaves may cause a litter problem. Three other species of Latan Palm can be told apart only by their leaf colour. Latan Palm makes a very good specimen palm tree for attracting attention, and can be planted on decks or patios in large gardens, as a specimen in a park or in containers."

"Riyadh","Lavandula angustifolia","description","Lavandula angustifolia is the common Lavender, a sub-shrub with a strong scent. The herb is indigenous to the Mediterranean, Alpine, Balkan and Caucasus. Lavender can also be found near Taif in the Asir Mountains, but is observed in Thumamah Natural Park in ravines as well. Maintained, it usually grows 40 cm high, but it can reach a height of 100 cm. Regularly pruning will keep the dwarf shrub densely branched, since otherwise it tends to become squarrose. In June to August, the typical strong-scented, blue or violet, ear-like flowers appear. The semi-evergreen leaves are lanceolate and silver-grey. The roots are shallow to deep, depending on the water supply. Lavender grows naturally on rocky silty soils. Because of its semi-evergreen leaves, the herb likes sufficient air humidity. The saline content of irrigation water should be low. Lavender can be propagated by sowing and pricking and with cuttings. In southern Europe, lavender is cultivated for the perfume industry. Lavender is used for medical reasons to cure inner agitation or digestive problems. For landscape design, this appealing aromatic herb can be utilised as grouped or massed planting, and as groundcover. It also fits in well in rock or steppe gardens, on wall tops or as small hedges as border plantations. In Arriyadh, Lavender can be used in private gardens, urban areas, park planting and open public space. Lavender does also well in containers and as topiary planting, and attracts bees."

"Riyadh","Lavandula dentata","description","Lavandula dentata is the Toothed Lavender, and has the English common name French Lavender. The herb is an evergreen sub-shrub with a strong scent. Toothed Lavender is native to the Mediterranean, northwest Africa, Balearic Islands and Portugal. Regular pruning is also required for the Toothed Lavender. The growth height varies between 30 and 100 cm. The lanceolate pastel-grey-green leaves are dentate. The blue-violet, ear-like flowers are 2 to 5 cm across. The upper petals have impressive appendages, which make this Lavender quite unique. This plant is popular because of its attractive foliage, flowers and refreshing scent. French Lavender prefers alkaline, rocky, silty and well-drained soils. Propagation is the same as for Common Lavender. Like L. angustifolia, and owing to its evergreen foliage, it requires humidity to grow well. A sunny location improves the flowering and scent, but in view of the extreme aridity of the Arriyadh region, and because it does not adapt well to desert conditions, it is best planted in the protected environment of a city garden. Irrigation should be medium with low salinity. The use for planting schemes is comparable to that of the other variety. A a groundcover, grouped or massed plantation, in edging plantations as small hedge, in natural gardens with themes such as rock or steppe gardens, it makes a good eye-catcher because of its ornamental shape. Sheltered planting in parks, public open spaces, containers and private gardens are suitable locations for the use of Lavender in Arriyadh."

"Riyadh","Lawsonia inermis","description","Egyptian Privet or Henna grows wild in the Hejaz where it has become naturalised on alluvial soils along watercourses. It is grown throughout the Kingdom as an ornamental shrub. Fast-growing, it reaches the proportions of a small tree. Henna is a somewhat straggly, many branched, glabrous shrub up to 6 metres high with a greyish-brown bark. The size of the small, pale grey-green, elliptical leaves is dependent on the availability of water. L. inermis bears numerous, very fragrant, usually whitish, sometimes reddish flowers, in large, pyramidal, terminal panicles, in summer. The globose fruit capsules, are purplish-green and many-seeded. Propagation is by cuttings or seed, and the thick seed coat must be pre-germinated before sowing. Henna requires full sun and high temperatures, and will survive light frosts. Very drought-resistant, it needs moderate water in summer and deep watering to improve its appearance during hot weather. It prefers stony and sandy soils, with good drainage, but adapts to heavy, fertile clay soils. It is not salt-tolerant. Henna is susceptible to only a very few pests and diseases. L. inermis is of great importance to Muslims, where it is used in marriage ceremonies: the leaves are ground into a paste that can be used to decorate the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet or to dye the hair. Tucked into a garden, it will provide an exclusive fragrance. It is also useful as a hedge plant, although clipping will remove the scented flowers. Careful pruning is necessary to keep the plant compact."

"Riyadh","Leucaena leucocephala","description","This is fast-growing tree, native to tropical America, which has become naturalised on all continents. In Arriyadh, too, it is now relatively common. Basically a weed, the habitats of which are watercourses, disturbed sites and often agricultural land, the Horse Tamarind is a small tree up to 10 metres tall with a slender trunk and rough, brown bark. It creates dense stands where conditions are favourable. The leaves are bright green, bipinnate and fine; the numerous white flowers, on long stalks, are like pin-cushions in spiky clusters. Trees are usually covered with the long, brown fruit pods, which can create a lot of litter and produce a multitude of seedlings. It is not frost-hardy and grows on most soils, though poorly on acid soil. It tolerates drought well, but needs irrigation until established. Trees are propagated by seed, which need scarification as well as cuttings. L. leucocephala responds well to fertiliser and soil liming. It is susceptible to insect infestations. At the end of the last century (CE), its use was heavily promoted as a shade plant on agricultural plantations, in land reclamation, erosion control, water conservation, reforestation and soil improvement programs. It is also used as a green manure crop (nitrogen fixation), for windbreaks and firebreaks. The Horse Tamarind requires more maintenance than is usual for an arid region plant, including regular grooming to improve its appearance, pruning after frost damage and weeding to remove unwanted seedlings. It should be used sparingly."

"Riyadh","Leucophyllum frutescens","description","Texas Ranger is a dense, grey-leaved shrub native to Texas and Mexico. Slow-growing, it reaches a height of 2.5 metres with an equal spread. The silvery-grey, soft leaves form a compact foliage and the masses of rose-purple flowers sometimes cover the whole plant, providing a splash of bright colour in summer and a pleasant fragrance in spring. L. frutescens requires full sun and likes intense heat: in the shade, it will become straggly. It is highly drought-resistant and grows best on well-drained, alkaline, sandy soil, which can be poor or stony. Being frost-tolerant, moderate watering is required, occasionally deep in summer, and waterlogging should be avoided. Propagation is by cuttings. Generally pest-free, it is susceptible to Texas (Cotton) root rot. This shrub is well adapted to desert conditions and was first introduced into Arriyadh’s residential areas in the early 1980s (CE) at the Staff Housing project for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where it was observed that it could also be sheared into hedges and shapes. There are many cultivars with a range of flower and leaf colours. It is excellent as a colourful accent and contrast to other greener plants, and for planting in transition zones between intensive and extensive landscapes. It can be used on roadsides, in parks and as a screen. Maintenance requirements are low; pruning back creates denser foliage."

"Riyadh","Lobelia erinus","description","Originating in South Africa, Lobelia is a herbaceous perennial, usually grown as an annual bedding plant and widely planted across the globe for summer colour. In Arriyadh, it is popular for winter colour displays. Plants are prostrate or scrambling up to 20 cm high. The light green leaves are oval, 10 mm long and 4–8 mm broad, with a serrated margin. Depending on the variety, flower colours are of various shades of blue, sometimes white, and borne in loose panicles; each flower is tubular, flattening out to a broad three- to five-lobed tip. Usually best in full sun, it will also tolerate shade in Arriyadh. Soils should be fertile and moist as well as well drained. Plants require abundant water, but should not be waterlogged in winter. Propagation is by seeds, which are poisonous. Generally pest-free, plants may suffer from stem and root rot. Lobelia is a well-known garden plant, grown for its long flowering period. In Arriyadh, it will survive mild frosts and continue flowering after its planting in late autumn until the heat of early summer, when it will begin to burn. L. erinus is normally used as an edging plant or groundcover; there are also trailing or cascading varieties, which are suitable for baskets, containers and the tops of walls. Apart from weeding, it requires little maintenance after being planted out."

"Riyadh","Mangifera indica","description","The unmistakable Mango Tree is a huge tree when mature, reaching a height of 30 metres with a broad, and rounded canopy of the same width. Native to India, Myanmar and Malaysia, this slow-growing, long-lived tree will not reach these proportions in Arriyadh, but it can still make an attractive, fruit-bearing tree when well cultivated and protected from frost. Nearly evergreen, alternate leaves, up to 30 cm long and 5 cm wide, are borne in rosettes at the tips of the branches; new leaves are yellowish to wine-red. Hundreds of small, yellowish flowers are borne in spring in large clusters. The fruits, varying in form, size, colour and quality depending on the variety, contain a single, flattened, pale, hard stone. Preferring rich, deep, well-drained soil, but not too particular with regard to soil type, the tap root may descend to a depth of 6 metres. It performs well in sand, gravel and on limestone. Mango trees grow readily from seed and require high nitrogen fertilisation in the early years. Drought tolerance is low and regular irrigation is required. Usually no pruning is done at first and then only to improve the form. The Mango has a great many predators: some secrete honeydew, giving rise to sooty mould on leaves. One serious disease is powdery mildew, controllable by regular spraying. Nutrient deficiency is indicated by paleness, distortion and limpness of foliage. Lack of iron produces chlorosis in young trees. Mangos are good as specimen shade trees in Arriyadh, but require high maintenance."

"Riyadh","Melia azedarach","description","Melia is also called Bead Tree, Chinaberry, Persian Lilac and Pride of India. Melia azederach is a deciduous tree that reaches a height of between 6 and 17 metres with a spread of up to 12 metres. Azederach comes from the Persian ‘azad dirakht’, and means ‘the gorgeous tree’. It originates from southwest Asia and western China. It has a broad open crown and often develops multi-branches. The fresh-green leaves are arranged alternately, with an ovate form and dentate margins. The lilac, violet and whitish-yellow flowers appear in spring, in panicles up to 25 cm long. The single flowers are about 1.5 cm in size. The tree flowers after three or four years for the first time. After flowering, the tree develops attractive round yellow berries, each about 1 cm in size. Prayer beads were once made from the seeds. Occasional pruning of the tree is recommended. Propagation can be done by seed and in good conditions by self-seeding and by runners. The Bead Tree normally grows in regions with an annual rainfall of between 600 and 1,000 mm. Accordingly, the tree responds well to air humidity and regular irrigation. It can also withstand medium salinity. As a younger tree, it may suffer from winter frost. In Arriyadh, it can be found in the Diplomatic Quarter in the inner Tuwaiq Palace garden. For use, it is recommended that this tree be planted in protected areas with appropriate microclimates, such as in parks or larger gardens, where it is also protected from wind damage. It is beautiful as a specimen tree or in small groups."

"Riyadh","Mentha × piperita","description","Peppermint is the common name for this herb and perennial plant. Mentha piperita is a cultivar derived from Mentha crispa and Mentha aquatica. It is known only in cultivation, so that the natural distribution cannot be named. This Mint grows to a height of 60 cm. Its leaves are ovate and fresh green, and the aromatic foliage is deciduous. The flowers appear in summer as pink spikes. Mentha loves a sunny location, but with good irrigated soil. For a favoured location, it can be used as grouped plantation or groundcover at pond edges or in swamps. With sun, the aromatic oils in the plant will be optimally developed. The leaves can be used for fresh mint tea, even when dry. In Arab countries, peppermint tea is served after dinner because of its good digestive properties, in addition to the refreshing taste. It has an anti-bacterial function; the aromatic oil helps with headaches and can be inhaled to alleviate colds. Mentha is not suitable for babies, because the oil is too strong. Propagation can be done by runners and cuttings which root easily. Sometimes, if the location meets the plant’s requirements, Mentha can be invasive, but can be easily controlled by reducing the water supply. Pruning from time to time, and at the beginning of a new season, will support the dense growth. In Arriyadh, Peppermint is highly attractive in private gardens next to ponds, because it can be harvested directly for a fresh tea. It is often found growing on farms."

"Riyadh","Morus nigra","description","Morus nigra has the common name Black Mulberry, in Arabic toot. It is a tree with deciduous foliage. Black Mulberry originates from West Asia and prefers a temperate climate. Mulberry was the host of the caterpillar that has been used for the production of silk. It grows to a height and spread of between 6 and 15 metres. The crown has a round regular shape. The leaves are dark green and cottony (pubescent) underneath. They are arranged alternately, with an ovate form and serrate margins. The flower is inconspicuous, but the fruit appears raspberry-like in a black purple egg-shaped berry. The fruit sap is very intense in colour, a consideration for their use next to footpaths, because of possible stains on the paving. Fruitless varieties are therefore more suitable in landscape design. The fruit is edible. The Mulberry likes penetrable, limey soils. The tree is propagated by seeds. Morus can withstand urban microclimates, but is vulnerable to desiccation. It therefore needs good irrigation with low salinity. Because of its requirements, the Black Mulberry is advisable for more sheltered situations, where microclimates provide air humidity, such as lawned areas. Morus can suffer from frost, and shelter against frost damage is advisable for young trees. Its use in urban design can be seen in public open space and park plantations, as well as in private parks. Morus is appealing as a specimen tree or in grouped planting. The tree has low maintenance requirements. Normally, pruning is not necessary with this slow-growing tree."

"Riyadh","Murraya paniculata","description","Orange Jessamine, named for its delicate orange blossom perfume, is a shrub or small tree which will reach a height and width of 4 metres. Originating in India and southeast Asia, and widely distributed in tropical countries, it has a lush, green, thick foliage of shiny, pinnate, aromatic leaves and masses of scented, waxy, white flowers in spring, summer and autumn, followed by small, bright red fruits. One of the best-loved garden shrubs in many countries, it is now often seen in Arriyadh, where it makes an excellent hedge, although clipping will reduce the number of flowers. It is frost-tender in Arriyadh, but will recover after a light pruning. Best in light shade, Murraya prefers an organically rich, well-drained soil. Regular fertilising and watering is required, although it will tolerate a dry period. Propagation is by seed and cuttings. Pests are not usually observed. Shrubs will need some pruning to keep them in shape and, if a hedge or formal shape is desired, clipping must be regular, because new growth recurs quickly. M. paniculata is also very useful as a free-growing screen and makes an ornamental accent plant in large containers."

"Riyadh","Musa acuminata","description","Dwarf Bananas grow to a height of just 2 or 3 metres, and originate from southeast Asia and northern Australia. They require abundant water and a warm location protected from wind. Frost will kill the leaves including the ‘stem’, which is made up of strong petioles. Like many other herbaceous plants, it instantly recovers from the corm after freezing, storm-breaking or severe pruning. It tolerates full sun or partial shade, but demands nutrient-rich soil with a high percentage of compost. Dwarf Bananas tolerate heat if abundant water is at hand without being stagnant. The plants are propagated by offsets which are best separated at the end of summer. If temperatures drop below 12°C, the growth stagnates without any sign of dormancy, except for the interrupted thirst. Above this temperature, the Banana Plant is one of the heaviest feeders grown in Arriyadh, where it is often seen in protected areas on farms. Liquid fertiliser applied every fortnight supports it best. However, a lesser outlay is the application of slow-release granules at the beginning of spring, summer and autumn. In winter, plants do best without supplemental watering and must not be fertilised. Shoots usually flower during their second year in hanging clusters with pale-yellow florets. They need another 6 months to ripen. Dwarf Bananas give an immediate feeling of an exotic, humid-tropical climate. They should be grown in locations sheltered from the wind, adjacent to a pond or as an accent plant in a courtyard."

"Riyadh","Musa × paradisiaca","description","The Sweet Banana, or mawz in Arabic, is one of the world’s largest herbaceous plants, which most people would consider a tree. In fact, the ‘trunk’ consists of combined leaf stalks, usually between 2 and 6 metres high. They are hybrids between two wild species, Musa balbisiana and Musa acuminata. Both parents originate from humid, tropical Asia where the hybrid’s cultivars ‘Dwarf Cavendish’ and ‘Grand Nain’ still make an important cash crop just as they do in tropical America. The only way to propagate Sweet Bananas is by separating their offshoots. After flowering and fruiting, the shoot dies and is followed by new sprouts. In time, a single banana grows into a stout, decorative clump. Its huge leaves may become 2.7 metres in length and 60 cm wide. Wind easily splits the spade along its veins, resulting in a frond-like appearance. They look best in locations protected from wind. The flowerbud resembles a purple heart that opens up numerous tubular florets between bracts. Along the hanging cluster, tiers are grown with up to 20 fruits each. These bunches are called ‘hands’, while the individual, yellow fruits are known as ‘fingers’. Since the banana plants are of tropical descent, they grow flowers and fruit at any time of the year. Commercial growers fear the Panama disease, a fungal infection (Fusarium) that attacks the roots. It is no serious hazard to private gardens or public parks where Sweet Bananas are often grown for their ornamental effects. Not frost-hardy, they are often seen in protected areas on farms."

"Riyadh","Nymphaea caerulea","description","The Blue Egyptian Water Lily or Blue Lotus – the original habitat may have been Egypt and East Africa – has been found to grow well in Arriyadh, under certain conditions and with high maintenance. An aquatic perennial with thick, black, spongy, tuberous rhizomes, which anchor in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, the leaves of this Water Lily are on leaf stalks that arise directly from the rhizome. They are large, flat, round in shape with notched margins and with a slit almost to the centre of the leaf, where the petiole is attached. Leaves are relatively short-lived and replaced regularly throughout the growing season. A single plant can cover an area of about 1 sq. m. The elegant, blue, spiky flowers, 10–15 cm across, are held above water on a strong stalk and appear from spring until the end of summer. Lasting for about four days, they open in mid-morning and close in late afternoon: they are sweetly fragrant. This Water Lily is easy to grow; it requires full sun, good soil and a minimum of 30 cm of water. It should not be planted near fountains or in fast-moving water; the plants also do not like wind. They are best planted in containers sunk into the pond and must be fertilised in the growing season in order to flower well. Propagation is simple, by division, and pot-grown plants should be divided and planted in fresh soil every year for good results. Susceptible to aphids and damaged by severe frost, the tropical Water Lily is a beautiful addition to a garden, but is not very suitable for public areas in Arriyadh."

"Riyadh","Nymphaea capensis","description","This other species of tropical Water Lily, native to Africa, is the Cape Blue Water Lily: it is closely related to Nymphaea caerulea and the Blue Lotus, as well as Nymphaea alba, the White Lotus. Similar in shape and appearance, the Cape Blue Water Lily is sky-blue in colour and the Blue Lotus is a brighter blue. It is found growing abundantly in freshwater habitats in southern Africa. N. capensis was introduced from its native South Africa to the USA, where many beautiful varieties were bred, for example, the Star Water Lilies, including ‘Lilac Star’. The flowers have a spicy perfume. Essentially, N. capensis has all the same attributes as N. caerulea: it is easily grown, but prefers high acidity in the water. The success of this species in Arriyadh is therefore somewhat dependent on this, but it has generally been as good as N. caerulea. It is considered hardy to a winter minimum of –1 to 4°C. The Cape Blue Water Lily grows best in full sun to partial shade and in relatively shallow water. All Water Lilies are heavy feeders: good, sieved garden loam is recommended, an accumulation of humus at the bottom of the pond is sufficient and nutrients should be added in the growing season. Maintenance of these plants is intensive: in very cold climates, these Water Lilies may be killed if left outdoors during winter."

"Riyadh","Ocimum basilicum","description","Ocimum basilicum is known by its common name Basil, or rayhan in Arabic. Its original distribution is from the Middle East to southeastern Europe and southwest Asia. Basil is an annual herb that can also enjoy a longer lifespan in regions with mild winters. It grows between 30 and 60 cm high, with a spread of up to 40 cm. The round leaves are highly aromatxic. Normally, the leaves are fresh green, but there is a variety with a very attractive dark-red to purplish-red foliage named Ocimum basilicum ‘Purpurascens’. The flower appears in summer in spikes with white 0.5–0.8 cm single flowers. The flowers of ‘Purpurascens’ are a light violet. Basil prefers a moist soil with low salinity, but likes sunny locations with low air humidity. Basil is a very tasty herb, but its use can also be recommended in landscape design for private parks and gardens, container planting and public open spaces. As grouped or massed planting, groundcover, or as a hedge or undergrowth, it will have a pleasing visual appeal. Readily growing from seed, it is often found growing on footpaths near restaurants in many parts of Arriyadh: in Addiriyyah, it can be seen in several places as spontaneous vegetation in the undergrowth of shrubs. This would indicate that it could be used more often in the planting of public open spaces. Propagation is by direct seeding, sowing, and pricking. The level of maintenance depends on the location, which means that only low maintenance is necessary under optimal conditions. Regularly pruning promotes a dense growth."

"Riyadh","Olea europaea","description","Olea europea is known in English as the Olive tree, and in Arabic zaytoun. Its distribution extends from the Mediterranean to southeast Africa and southwest Asia. The tree can grow to between 6 and 9 metres high with a spread of 6 to 8 metres. Often, the Olive tree features a very picturesque growth with a dense crown. The leaves are entire and lanceolate, with the typical olive green on the top and silvery-green underneath. The flowers are unimpressive, but the fruits are famous and popular in all regions where olive trees grow. Maintenance is minimal; regular pruning will densify the crown. Olives do not like stagnant water, but otherwise have no special soil requirements. Frost-tolerant to –10°C, the trees are prone to attack by scale insects and crown gall; verticillium wilt and black scale can also become problems. It is a shelter plant, and can be used in open public spaces, park planting and urban areas. Olives can also be grown in small managed roof gardens or containers. For landscape design, however, it should be recognised that the Olive is a fruit tree, i.e. its use is inadvisable next to pedestrian areas. Olives make appealing trees as specimens, grouped planting or linear planting. They will lend a natural Mediterranean garden flair to steppe gardens. Propagation is by cuttings and grafting. To ensure optimal development of the tree, it is necessary to provide a minimum of air humidity. Olive tree plantations have been successful in Arriyadh, and can now be seen quite often."

"Riyadh","Opuntia ficus-indica","description","Although its species name means ‘Indian Fig’, this cactus is much better known as Prickly Pear, or sabbar in Arabic. It may grow like a shrub. It consists of paddle-shaped segments which eventually become round, forming a solid branch. Both trunk and branches do not build solid wood, but rather a spongy tissue which is robust enough to bear the heavy, fleshy crown. Its origin is allegedly Mexico. It is one of the few New World cacti growing in Saudi Arabia, and is often seen on farms in Arriyadh. In spring, beautiful, bright-yellow flowers appear at the upper edges of the segments. After fertilisation by numerous kinds of insects, the base becomes swollen to develop into a delicious-tasting, egg-shaped fruit. Green at first, this turns yellow, orange and finally deep purple when fully ripe. The segments may or may not feature the thorns that so many cacti are known for. Thorny varieties are set around fields as a living fence, while bare cultivars are grown for their fruit as hedges or specimens. They are often planted ornamentally as an impenetrable ground cover. All Prickly Pear fruits are armed with tiny, apparently harmless areoles that bear bristly glochids. These penetrate human skin instantly causing a nasty itching for hours or days, since they are difficult to remove. Segments easily root if buried to one third in well-drained soil. Apart from the water permeability, the soil can have any properties; and it can have some salinity. There are no problems with heat, or full or even reflected sun."

"Riyadh","Osteospermum fruticosum","description","The African Daisy is a fast-growing groundcover for large open spaces and on slopes. It grows in full sun, thrives with moderate watering, but takes some drought; most types of soil are acceptable, and the plant is wind-resistant. Pests and diseases are rare, which means this South African plant is ideal for low-maintenance uses. Too much fertiliser results in leggy, tender stems that grow criss-cross while extreme heat in Arriyadh can cause the plant’s growth to stagnate. The foliage is spoon-shaped, bright green and some 5 cm in length. In blossom for most of the year, it is topped by scores of spectacular daisy flowers some 8 cm across. The outer ring is either white or lavender with a violet centre of fertile inflorescences. Spent flowers may be discarded to encourage the development of new buds. The plant grows 20 to 30 cm high, but spreads readily by creeping stems that become rooted wherever they touch soil. It is therefore very easy to propagate by cuttings or separating layers. African Daisies look well cascading over edges, in containers or in beddings. They suit rock gardens and like border planting alike, and since they need little attention they may be grown in both private gardens and public parks. In colder climates, they are grown annually or as pot plants, since they flower abundantly even when young. Despite its vigorous growth the plant does not escape from its designated site. In the immediate neighbourhood, slow-growing perennials or small shrubs that could be overgrown should be avoided."

"Riyadh","Encelia farinosa","description","Encelia, or Brittlebush, is a woody perennial or sub-shrub that is native to the Sonoran and Mojave deserts of northern Mexico and the southwestern USA. Seen up until now in only a few locations in Arriyadh – there is a flourishing enclave at Kasr Tuwaiq in the Diplomatic Quarter – it has great potential for widespread use. It grows from 60 to 90 cm high, and up to 150 cm wide. The evergreen leaves are silvery light grey. The bright yellow, daisy-like flowers are 2 cm in diameter, on long, thin stems above the foliage, as if they were floating above the shrub, which they cover in spring. The Brittlebush is completely adapted to desert conditions. Fast growing, especially after a wet winter, it needs nearly no irrigation once established. It will, however, die out after some years when very dry, only to make a comeback after self-seeding. It is tolerant of neither high salinity nor light frost, after which it will recover in spring. Encelia prefers full sun or partially sunny locations, and sandy or rocky soil with good drainage. Propagation can be done by seed or with cuttings. If self-seeding is not required, pruning of florescence after flowering is advisable, and trimming of branches in autumn will encourage dense growth. Attractive planting schemes with bright spots of colour can be created with E. farinosa as a small hedge, in grouped or massed planting in public open spaces and urban areas, as well as in park or street median planting and in pedestrian precincts and containers. It is an eye-catching plant in rock gardens."

"Riyadh","Acacia pycnantha","description","An erect or spreading, medium-sized shrub or small tree, usually multi-stemmed from or near ground level, this Australian native acacia is also the country’s floral emblem. This is a very showy wattle and has been chosen as suitable for conditions in the Arriyadh region. It has a smooth or finely fissured, dark brown to greyish bark with angled branchlets and bright-green, sickle-shaped phyllodes. Large, sweetly-scented, golden ball-shaped flowers occur in spring in very dense clusters, providing a vivid contrast to the foliage. Seed pods are straight or curved. Usually growing in the understorey of dry woodland and heath, on sandy and stony soil in open scrub formations, A. pycnantha is tolerant of slightly to moderately saline soil and is also moderately frost-tolerant. It is fast-growing, but tends to be short-lived in cultivation: plants require a well-drained, sunny position with ample watering. The shallow and spreading roots are nitrogen-fixing. Propagation is from scarified seed, pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard coating. Widely planted as an ornamental, on account of its profusion of flowers, it is a popular garden or feature plant that attracts wildlife. In Australia, trees regenerate freely after fires, which, although killing the plants, help the germination of seed stored in the soil, if rain occurs soon after. Such regeneration may produce dense thickets. Few maintenance measures are necessary A. pycnantha is best pruned to allow multi-stems to develop, since otherwise it may become lanky."

"Riyadh","Pandanus sanderi","description","Native to Polynesia, the variegated Screw Pine is a slow-growing, suckering shrub up to 6 metres high, with thick aerial roots and distinctive green- and yellow-striped leaves. There are many species of the genus: P. utilis and P. veitchii are also successful in Arriyadh. This species has few branches and rarely flowers: it produces rosettes of arching, linear, spiny yellow leaves, up to 1 metre long, with green margins, when mature. Male and female flowers lack petals and are borne on separate plants. Female flowers resemble small, red-coloured pineapples when fertilised. The Screw Pine has a high drought tolerance, but grows well in moist, sandy, clayey, alkaline soils, even with high salinity. It does best with regular irrigation, minimal in winter, and fertilising monthly from spring to summer. It is a very adaptable plant, although it prefers hot, dry conditions; propagation is by cuttings, which root readily when placed directly in the soil. It is occasionally infested by scale insects. Amongst the uses of Pandanus are the leaves used for weaving material for clothes, dyes collected from the roots and treatment of inflammation. A palm-like tree, it makes a spectacular accent in garden landscapes, but requires sufficient space. It is also an attractive screen when planted on the edge of a lake. Very little maintenance is necessary when planted in groups in a park."

"Riyadh","Parkinsonia aculeata","description","Known as both the Mexican Palo Verde and the Jerusalem Thorn, this small, fast-growing tree is native to the southwestern United States and Mexico. It was one of the first ornamental trees to be introduced into Saudi Arabia. A rounded, graceful tree, usually with a multi-stemmed, green trunk, drooping branches and slender twigs, it grows up to 8 metres high and 5 metres wide. The foliage is short-lived under desert conditions, but when the trees become leafless, the petioles of the leaves remain like silky needles. They are bordered by two rows of 25–30 tiny oval leaflets; during drought, the tree becomes deciduous. The branches have sharp spines 7–12 mm long. Sporadically blooming, loose clusters of fragrant, golden-yellow flowers with an orange-reddish coloured throat, make a striking display in spring and are followed by slender bean pods up to 15 cm long. P. aculeata prefers well-drained, sandy and alkaline, alluvial soils. In full sun, it will need watering until it becomes established. It is a very hardy tree, and tolerant of frost, wind, salinity and drought. Propagation is by seed. It is prone to attacks by red spider mites and mealybugs. Some countries have registered invasion problems: it is now a serious, widespread weed in Australia. Extremely attractive for landscape design, its graceful form has a residential scale and provides filtered shade: it is also suitable as a street tree and for screening. Maintenance is moderate: leaf litter will require removal. Pruning is necessary to create the desired shape."

"Riyadh","Pelargonium graveolens","description","Rose Geranium is grown for its intensely scented leaves. It is an erect, branched bush growing to 1 metre high with equivalent width, originating from the Cape Province, South Africa. Its hairy, fleshy stems become woody and brittle with age and are densely covered with evergreen, wrinkled foliage in fresh green. Coated in glandular hair, they instantly release a strong odour of roses, hence its common name. Its fragrance is also the reason for the species’ name since, in Latin, graveolens means strong-smelling. They are used to manufacture geranium oil which is far less expensive than true rose oil. The pink or white flowers are smaller and less showy than the floral display of its relative Garden Geranium. Nevertheless, they look attractive and enhance a mixed border from late winter to summer, with a peak in spring. Rose Geraniums are used to hot summers and mild winters without frost. They do best in semi-shade positions protected from full sun in the early afternoon, and are an attractive addition to a garden in Arriyadh. The soil should be moist all year round, but brief periods of drought are tolerated. The plants are best grouped close to walkways to facilitate occasional brushing by pedestrians. They grow well in pots and containers if drainage is adequate. Soils may range from acidic to alkaline, but should not be compacted. Poor soils should be improved by compost, and some slow-release fertiliser every so often is welcome. Set amongst taller shrubs, this healthy plant makes an ideal filler."

"Riyadh","Pennisetum setaceum","description","Pennisetum setaceum is called by its common name Fountain Grass, while in Arabic it is often referred to as halfah. Its area of distribution ranges from northern Africa, to tropical Africa, the Arabian peninsula, the Middle East and southwest Asia. This perennial grass grows between 90 cm and 1.2 metres high, with a spread of up to 1.5 metres. The flowers arrive in early summer as spikes up to 20 cm long. This grass is a very attractive ornamental plant that requires only low maintenance. Occasionally, pruning will densify the clump and cause it to rejuvenate better. Propagation is recommended by seeds and through division. Fountain Grass can be used in open country, for hillside planting and as a slope or bank stabiliser. In urban planting design, it is well known in many locations in Arriyadh. In King Fahd Road, the Murabba Parks, Wadi Hanifah and also in many private gardens, Fountain Grass is a long-time favourite because it provides light and beautiful images as groundcover, linear planting and grouped or massed planting. Another variety, Pennisetum setaceum ‘Cupreum’, is not as hardy as the green variety, but just as attractive. Its leaves are dark or purple-red, and the flower spikelets are light pink. More sheltered situations such as the Diplomatic Quarter and the Tuwaiq Palace inner garden are good locations for its use, where it is not so exposed to occasional frosts. Soil and irrigation requirements are comparable to those of the main species, i.e. very low, but stagnant water is not well tolerated."

"Riyadh","Pentas lanceolata","description","Egyptian Stars is a tender, perennial herb or subshrub native to eastern Africa and the southern Arabian peninsula, where plants are found in the wild on the edge of woodland and in scrub. Many varieties of Pentas have been bred, and they are suitable for garden planting in Arriyadh. With an upright growth habit, this shrub will reach a height of 1 metre and a width of about half this. It has quite hairy, dark-green, lanceolate, deeply veined leaves up to 8 cm long and showy clusters of never-ending, red, white, lavender, purple, or pink, star-shaped flowers. Flowering begins in spring and continues until the autumn. Plants require a neutral, moderately fertile, well-drained soil that retains moisture well, and should be planted in light shade or sun, but not in direct sun during the hottest part of the day. Irrigation and fertilising should be regular throughout the growing season, and less in winter. Egyptian Stars is not frost-tolerant, and is sometimes planted as an annual and not a perennial; in a sheltered location in Arriyadh, however, it may become a long-lived shrub. In hot weather, the plant grows fast and stays in bloom constantly. Propagation is by cuttings and from seed. Prone to white fly, they are generally disease-resistant. A neat compact plant can be maintained by pinching out the tips in spring: flowers are self-dead-heading. These are attractive plants for both containers and the garden. The bright red variety in the ‘Graffiti’ series has a spectacular colour and is a great nectar source."

"Riyadh","Phoenix canariensis","description","The Canary Island Date Palm, native to the Canary Islands, is a relative of Phoenix dactylifera, the true date palm. The difference between the two is easily recognized by Canary Island Date Palm’s crown of dark green fronds (P. dactylifera has blue-green fronds) and the pineapple shape of the short, thick trunk (P. dactylifera is tall and straight). P. canariensis is widely planted as an ornamental plant, particularly in areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is often seen in Arriyadh, where the difference goes unnoticed, except by botanists. It is less frost- and drought-tolerant than P. dactylifera. It is a large-spreading, densely branched palm, up to 18 metres tall and 15 m wide. The glossy green leaves are pinnate, with sharp spines along the lower part of the stem. Fruit is produced on female palms as an oval, yellow to orange drupe containing a single seed, and is of poor quality. A slow-growing tree requiring full sun, it is frost-tolerant to –7°C for only a short period. P. canariensis prefers a rich, moist, alluvial, sandy soil: salinity tolerance is medium. Irrigation requirements are moderate. Propagation is by seed. Many pests attack this palm: giant palm borer weevils, leaf skeletonisers and scale. It is also susceptible to lethal yellowing, fusarium and ganoderma fungal diseases. The high maintenance of this palm involves trimming to enhance its appearance: they are often ‘pineappled’ to stop fronds from touching cars or pedestrians, as well as clearing fruit litter. It is best planted along roads and in parks."

"Riyadh","Phoenix dactylifera","description","The Date Palm is native to the Kingdom and is widely cultivated in groves throughout the country. It grows slowly to a height of 25 metres and a spread of 12 metres. It may take 15 years to attain 3 metres. The stiff, sharp-pointed, pinnate leaves are over 3 metres long. The length and shape of the leaves vary according to the cultivars. A tree can form 10–20 leaves a year, depending on the cultivar and agricultural practices. The floral buds in the axils of the leaves bring forth spikes of small, yellowish flowers from late February to May. Date Palms are naturally wind-pollinated, but on farms they are manually pollinated by skilled labourers; a male tree produces enough pollen to pollinate up to 50 female trees. When pollinated, female trees produce large pendulous clusters of cylindrical orange to brown fruits, which stand out from the base of the fronds. Dates when unripe, they range from red to bright yellow in colour. The Date Palm requires full sun, but will tolerate shade. Trees are frost-resistant. Being drought-tolerant, regular irrigation is necessary for good fruits, and the plants appreciate deep watering in summer. In winter, a tree will need only half of the summer irrigation rate. The tree prefers well-drained, deep, sandy loams and tolerates salinity. It is best planted in late spring or summer. Date Palms require good and regular fertilising. Tree hole lancing with a mixture of sand and fertiliser in spring is also very effective. Propagation is by seed or best from suckers. Date Palms are affected by many pests, which attack the trunk and growing points. The most dangerous is the Red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus), which is difficult to detect in the early stages of infestation. The initial signs are holes and the oozing of a brown viscous liquid on the trunk or in the crown. Eventually, the entire crown of the tree will wither and begin to fall off. This is now a worldwide problem. Weak or transplanted large specimens seem to be the main victims. Other pests are leaf skeletonisers and scale insects. Date palms require intensive maintenance and cultivation. Date Palms are easily transplanted to new locations and there are specific procedures for this. The Date Palm is a magnificent, all-round tree, spectacular in culture on farms, and it lends itself splendidly to landscape design in Arriyadh. It makes a beautiful, almost ceremonial roadside tree. Seen on a skyline, it produces an oasis effect. Too large for most small gardens, it is an excellent park tree, as a specimen or background planting or for shade on pathways. It is also effective when planted near tall buildings."

"Riyadh","Phoenix roebelenii","description","The Pygmy Date Palm, native to southeast Asia, is one of the most commonly used kinds of dwarf palms. In Arriyadh, it is suitable for small gardens and courtyards, but needs some shade from the sun. A very long-lived, slow-growing slender tree up to 3 metres tall, this palm likes partial shade to full sun; morning sun is recommended. It has a dense crown of leaves that are 60–120 cm long, and pinnate with some 100 leaflets. Each leaflet is 15–25 cm long and 1 cm across, slightly drooping, and bright green in colour with scurfy pubescence below; the thorns at the base of the frond are very sharp. The flowers are small and yellowish: the fruit is a 1-cm drupe, resembling a small, thin-fleshed date. In nature, the trees are usually single-trunked, in cultivation multiple trunks are often produced. Very frost-tolerant for short periods of time, they are also drought- and saltwater-tolerant. They like a fertile, well-drained soil with moderate moisture levels and respond well to regular applications of fertiliser. The trees adapt to most soils and tolerate waterlogging, clay, loam or sandy soils, low in nutrients. Regular irrigation is required. Propagation is by seed or division. The Pygmy Date Palm is generally pest- and disease-free. It requires little pruning to develop a strong structure; old and dead fronds should be trimmed below the spines. Graceful in appearance, P. roebelenii is a popular ornamental plant which looks well by poolsides, on patios, in shopping malls and office entrances, and is a perfect container plant."

"Riyadh","Phragmites australis","description","The common name for this plant is Reed Grass, or in Arabic, ghab. Its area of distribution ranges from Alaska and Australia to the Balkans. Phragmites is a perennial grass which is both heat- and frost-tolerant. It grows to a height of between 90 cm and 2.5 metres. It is a fast-growing grass with strong rhizomes. It can be invasive in situations where all conditions are optimal for its development. It can also withstand high salinity. The flowers appear as impressive florets between 20 and 35 cm in size. The spike has a violet-magenta colour. The inflorescence appears in early September and remains on the plant for a long time, keeping the grass attractive throughout the winter. Reed Grass grows close to water edges, on shorelines. Phragmites is well known in the Wadi Hanifah and the Al Hair Lakes. Because it is such a strong plant, its use is not advisable for small ponds. For natural water features such as the Al Hair Lakes, however, it is a valuable plant species because of its water-cleansing properties. It helps to maintain the natural water ecosystem in equilibrium. Reed Grass is a phytoremediation or water-treatment plant, and provides a habitat for many different varieties of wildlife. Accordingly, Phragmites is a useful plant for bank stabilisation, open country and environmental consolidation. It can also be used as screen. It becomes a dominant plant very quickly. Recommended propagation measures are by runners, division and direct sowing. Maintenance is recommended through periodically pruning where necessary."

"Riyadh","Pinus halepensis","description","The Aleppo Pine is native to the Mediterranean region; its range extends into the Middle East. Pine trees are not generally seen in Arriyadh, because of the high temperatures and alkaline soils; however, P. halepensis is tolerant of such conditions and is occasionally seen in protected locations. P. eldarica is another pine which would grow in Arriyadh. An evergreen, moderate- to fast-growing tree, up to 20 metres high and 6 metres wide and a large trunk of up to 1 metre diameter, its bark is thick, fissured and reddish in colour. When young, its growth is pyramidal; at maturity, it has an open, irregular, rounded crown with huge lateral branches. The characteristic, yellowish-green, needle-like leaves are very slender, 10 cm long and produced in pairs. The flowers are inconspicuous in brown bundles at the end of the branches. The green cones are narrow, oval, up to 12 cm long and open slowly, ripening to glossy red-brown. P. halepensis is frost-tender when young, but mature trees withstand severe frosts. It prefers full sun and reflected heat; tolerating partial shade, when young, it will grow in poor soils, except wet types. Most drought-tolerant in good soil, it does best with irrigation, 2–3 times per month. Propagation is by seed, and plants require little feeding. Prone to mites and aphids, maintenance is low; pruning is seldom required after establishment. Aleppo Pine is used in afforestation in the Middle East. It is a popular ornamental tree for planting in large private gardens, and in parks in hot dry areas."

"Riyadh","Pithecellobium dulce","description","Pithecellobium dulce is called by its common name Madras Thorn, or in Arabic lawz hindi. It originally comes from Mexico, Florida and southeast Asia. Pithecellobium dulce is a tree growing up to 8 metres high with a spread of about 5 metres. The leaves are green and entire, and bipinnately arranged. The flower size is about 12 cm and the colour is greenish-white with a good flavour. After flowering, aromatic pods appear with an edible sweet pulp. The tree will be propagated by direct seeding. P. dulce is resistant to urban microclimates and drought. It needs medium irrigation and withstands a medium salinity content in irrigation water. In landscape design, the tree is very useful as a screen or plant providing shelter. Urban areas, public open spaces, park planting and street planting are also areas where this tree may be used. The tree is effective as a specimen, in grouped planting, in avenues and as linear planting. In Arriyadh, it is planted in many streets and other locations, but the median of King Fahd Road is one of the harshest locations possible that can be considered for the survival of a plant, where it is still standing after more than 17 years. This makes Pithecellobium a very valuable plant for urban design in Arriyadh, because of its low requirements, ability to adapt to unfavourable situations and the wide range of possible uses. In Addiriyyah, it has been planted as a high-trunked specimen along roads, with good results."

"Riyadh","Plumbago auriculata","description","In its native region from the Cape Province to Natal, the Leadwort grows up to 4 metres high and 6 metres wide under ideal conditions. An excellent shrub or climber in Arriyadh, it seems to have adapted well to the growing conditions there. Owing to tiny glands, the foliage slightly adheres to the skin or clothes. The Latin name auriculata refers to the ear-shaped leaf base, and Plumbago includes the Latin word for lead because it allegedly healed lead poisoning. Flowers may appear for a very long time, but between June and September the Cape Leadwort is coated in sky blue. ‘Alba’ is a white-flowering cultivar and ‘Royal Cape’ has intensely blue flowers. The campanulate inflorescences attract butterflies. Following pollination, seed capsules, develop retaining their adhesion to allow distribution by passing animals. In its natural habitat, this climber is associated with the Cape Honeysuckle (Tecomaria capensis). It may be trained to cover a fence, or grow against a wall or along a trellis. It takes hard pruning and will even flower within the same year. Its limited size means that it can climb into trees without suffocating them. An interesting feature is the suckers that may allow the Cape Leadwort to grow as a large-scale areal cover. It resists drought, and thrives in any type of soil. However, additional watering and high levels of humus and nutrients are welcome. Frost may cause foliage and slender twigs to die back, but plants quickly recover. Propagation may be carried out by cuttings, suckers and seeds."

"Riyadh","Plumeria obtusa","description","In warm, protected sites, this shrub retains its leaves, while they are usually shed in Arriyadh’s winter and sometimes succumb to frost. Although called Singapore Plumeria, the species originates from central America including the Bahamas and the Lesser Antilles. Nowadays, it is widely spread throughout tropical climates where temperatures do not drop below 4°C. In some regions, it is also called Temple Tree, and in fact it might reach a height of 8 metres with a width of 6 metres fairly quickly, and is easily trained as a standard if the strength of the trunk is sufficient to bear the weight of the crown. Irregular in shape. it will eventually develop an umbrella-like canopy. The leaves are leathery, dark green and shiny. reaching some 25 cm in length and are obovate in shape. They are arranged spirally around the green branches. From June to November, strongly scented flowers enchant garden owners or passers-by. They are white with a yellow throat, measuring up to 7 cm across. Singapore Plumerias grow in locations varying from full sun to semi-shade, and should be protected against strong, drying winds. Although deriving from the humid tropics, they tolerate low air humidity fairly well. They do not stand drought for long, and are vulnerable to waterlogging. The best soils are well drained and fertile, with high levels of humus, and frequent irrigation. Cuttings from the fleshy stems root easily in a mix of compost and coarse sand. Any injury causes white sap to be exuded, which is toxic and may irritate the skin."

"Riyadh","Plumeria rubra f. acutifolia","description","Frangipani thrives in high temperatures and high air humidity. It originates in central America, including the West Indies. Usually grown as shrubs, it may also become a multi-trunk tree. Standards require staking over a long period until the stem is strong enough to bear the heavy crown. Like many other members in the oleander family Apocynaceae, the branches and foliage contain white, toxic latex. The thick, green twigs are spaced widely, but shiny, dark-green leaves still make a dense crown. The leaves are deciduous, alternately arranged and lanceolate. Waxy flowers appear in bunches from June through to October. Their colour may vary: white, pink, yellow or red. They all have an intense scent, for which they received their common name, after the Marquis Muzio Frangipani. Frangipani managed to create a perfume similar to the scent of Plumeria. The shrubs are delicate, and easily damaged by frost in Arriyadh. If they are to embellish an unfavourable site such as a terrace, Frangipani can be grown in pots, so that they can be moved during the coldest months. Frangipani is easily propagated in February and March by hardwood cuttings about 40 cm long. The cut surface must be dried completely to avoid fungal infection. Seedlings take several years to produce flowers for the first time. During the growing season, the plant appreciates plenty of water and fertiliser. Pests such as scale insects and diseases are rarely a problem. Pruning is simple and should be done in February, but the exuded sap may irritate the gardener’s skin."

"Riyadh","Portulacaria afra","description","This popular succulent is native to scrub vegetation, thickets and dry riverbeds in eastern South Africa and Mozambique. The Porkbush is now planted around the world for its ability to survive certain extremes. It stands heat and drought even as a pot plant, and may be used as a bonsai. It is often seen on footpaths and in planters in Arriyadh. The Porkbush usually grows as an oval or round shrub some 2 metres high, but under favourable conditions it can reach double this size. Reddish-brown, fleshy stems are aligned with round, succulent foliage. In early spring, tiny flowers emerge in light pink. Porkbushes take severe pruning. In its homeland, they are occasionally browsed by elephants and quickly recover from the base. Clipping and pinching allow the plant to be grown in any sculptural shape desired, or as a hedge. It can be grouped or grown as a specimen plant in rock gardens and any arid landscape. Some cultivars have peculiar characteristics, such as ‘Aurea’ with its yellow-green foliage and ‘Foliis variegatis’ with ivory leaf edges.  Interesting is ‘Limpopo’ with larger, ovate leaves up to 3 cm in length and 2 cm in width. The foliage is edible and somewhat sour in taste. It brings relief to sore throats and cure mouth infections, as well as insect stings and sunburns. Its deep roots and resistance to drought make this shrub an ideal soil stabiliser on slopes. Both full sun and semi-shade are accepted. Propagation is very simple by cuttings that should be allowed to dry before being placed in a mix of sand and compost."

"Riyadh","Prosopis juliflora","description","The Common Mesquite, known as ghaf bahri in Arabic, has its origins in tropical America, and most probably ‘invaded’ Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states during the late 1950s (CE) from Indo-Pakistan. Mesquite has a loose, spreading crown of twigs and fern-like foliage on a short trunk with rough, dark-brown bark. A fast-growing, deciduous tree up to 7 metres tall and 10 metres wide, armed with pairs of spines, it has alternate, bipinnate, dull-green, and in spring bright-green, leaves. The drooping, creamy-white flower tassels up to 10 cm long appear in mid-spring. The slightly curved pods are up to 12 cm long, and are brown when ripe. P. juliflora grows in sandy and silty soil and has long invasive roots; it tolerates a high water table as well as inundation and extreme salinity. It requires full sun and is frost-tolerant, but the foliage will suffer considerably after very sharp frosts. Although extremely drought-tolerant, it grows very slowly without water: occasional deep irrigation promotes better growth. Propagation is by seeds, root suckers, and hardwood cuttings. An invasive species keeping down indigenous grass and shrubs, the Mesquite is not usually browsed. More attractive as a multi-trunked tree, good staking and frequent pruning of a straight strong leader are necessary for a tall standard. A dripping dark fluid can stain paving, while some people are allergic to the pollen. Leaf and pod litter is a problem. Trees are very suitable for afforestation, soil erosion control, stabilisation of sand dunes, and soil improvement."

"Riyadh","Punica granatum","description","The common name of this medium-sized shrub is Pomegranate, or rumman in Arabic. It has its origins in southwest and central Asia. It can be found throughout the Mediterranean, and is frequent in the farms and gardens of Arriyadh. The Pomegranate prefers a Mediterranean to sub-tropical climate. The slow-growing tree reaches a height between 2 and 7 metres. The crown is mostly dense and round in shape. The foliage is green and the shoots pastel-red. The leaves are arranged oppositely, and their form is entire and lanceolate. The flowers and fruits are often found together on one plant. Flowering begins in spring. The bloom is a calyx in deep-orange to bright-red. The ripe fruit is bright red. It is apple-shaped and round. The fruit contains granate, red, pearl-like juicy pits which are edible and very healthy. Maintenance requirements are moderate, because the shrub is slow growing; pruning is not often required. Punica granatum has no major soil requirements. Irrigation should be medium and the salinity content not higher than medium. The air-humidity should be sufficient. The plant otherwise loves a sunny location and it is heat-resistant. Propagation is by sowing and pricking. Pomegranates are highly attractive as specimens and as grouped plants, together with plenty of potential for linear planting and hedges. This bee-attracting plant is useful for screens, in public open spaces, as park planting, in pedestrian precincts and in private parks. The possible fruit drop should be taken into account when grown next to pathways."

"Riyadh","Quisqualis indica","description","Rangoon Creeper grows wild in southeast Asia from Myanmar (Burma) to the Philippines, and is often seen as an ornamental climber in Arriyadh. It may become naturalised in humid climates, forming thickets in secondary forests, but will not invade intact ecosystems. The generic name is the Latin question What is that?, while the specific name describes its origin from tropical Asia. This ligneous vine may quickly reach a height of 8 metres. It is cultivated for attractive, fragrant flowers that open pale pink, turning to intense red while blooming. In open clusters, the star-like flowers are arranged on slender, long funnels appearing mainly in summer. They develop into winged, black fruits some 3 cm in size. The leaves are up to 15 cm long, and arranged oppositely along the woody twigs. Light frosts are not harmful, while the shrub recovers in spring if it has died back or following hard pruning. Planting locations should be in full sun to partial shade. Some drought is tolerated in nutrient-rich soils that should be well drained. The ground should not be compacted, and can range from acidic to alkaline. Being resistant to urban microclimates and limited in size, Quisqualis makes an ideal low-maintenance vine in Arriyadh. It is grown widely in private gardens and public parks for its attractive, scented flowers. Kept under control by clipping, it also performs well in containers. Double flowers are born on a cultivar named ‘Thai Hybrid’."

"Riyadh","Rosa chinensis","description","Rosa chinensis, the China Rose, comes from central China, as the name indicates. The rose grows as a shrub up to a height of 2 metres. A number of different varieties have been cultivated for hundreds of years in China, so it is not easy to recognise the differences between wild roses and the cultivars. The cultivars appear in a very wide range of colours when they flower. The rose is a beautiful ornamental plant. Roses bloom in early summer, and release a strong fruity scent. The China Rose flowers repetitively, and is referred to as remontant. It came to Europe in the late eighteenth century, and about 200 different cultivars were bred with filled blossom. For the most part, their colours were red and pink, but not yellow. Roses prefer a sunny location with ample irrigation and nutrients. Pruning is required after flowering. In landscape design, roses are suitable for planting in sheltered locations such as parks, private gardens and as a container plant. In Arriyadh, they can be seen in several private parks and gardens. But even outside of Arriyadh, this rose is sufficiently hardy, for example, in sheltered court yards. It can be planted as an accent plant, in groups or as massed planting. Like all species of roses, R. chinensis is a shrub for plant enthusiasts. Susceptible to all kinds of pests and diseases, they need constant attention and knowledge for optimal development, growth and bloom."

"Riyadh","Rosa wichuraiana","description","This form of wild rose, first collected in its native Japan, has several cultivars which are commonly grown as rambling roses, suitable for planting as climbers in the protected garden in Arriyadh. With a rapid growth rate, this dense and vigorous, vine-like shrub forms green highly pliable stems up to 6 metres long. It has glossy, leathery leaves 5 to 10 cm long with seven leaflets, and rich, long-lasting, inflorescences composed of fragrant, apple-scented panicles of small, white flowers with five petals and prominent yellow stamens. These are followed by dark-red, rose-hip fruits. This rose will grow in most fertile, well-drained garden soils in full sun, and is very frost hardy. Slightly drought-tolerant, the rose benefits from deep watering every three to four weeks in summer. Fertilising should be done at the beginning of the growing season, with mature manure around the base of the rose canes every two to three years. They require pre-emptive treatment with insecticide and systemic fungicide to prevent attack by aphids and the development of fungal diseases. Rambling roses require more than a trellis for support. They are excellent on the side of a building, fence or shade structure, but require securing on stakes and strong fastening to structures. They will also grow into the branches of a tree when planted close together, which means that a non-blooming tree appears to bear flowers. This a plant with high maintenance requirements, best suited to a plant enthusiast’s private garden."

"Riyadh","Roystonea regia","description","The Royal Palm, native to Florida, Mexico and the Caribbean, has been planted throughout the subtropics and tropics as an ornamental tree. This tall and beautiful palm once lined an avenue in Arriyadh’s oldest park, the Foutah Gardens, just south of Murabba. The Royal Palm grows to a height of 20–30 metres with a spread of 9 metres; its trunk, up to 50 cm in diameter, has characteristic swellings, just below the long, bright-green crown shaft from which the large feathery leaves emerge, and a lesser bulge at the base. The smooth, light-grey bark has rings where the fronds once were. Arching, pinnate leaves, which can be up to 4 m long, are a lush green. The panicles of white flowers in summer are followed by small, berry like fruits, purplish-black when ripe. R. regia prefers deep, fertile, well-drained, neutral soil and full sun. Frost-tender, it withstands short periods of cold, but may be killed by temperatures below –4ºC. It requires regular irrigation, but should never stand in water. Propagation is from small, round seeds. Being fast-growing, Royal Palms are highly recommended for roadside planting, on boulevards, ceremonial driveways and parks. Owing to their size, they are not suitable for small gardens. A disadvantage is that trees let large leaves snap off in order to reduce wind resistance, which can be a hazard. Maintenance is intensive, since Royal Palms are susceptible to many insects. especially palm leaf skeletonisers, palmetto weevils and Royal Palm bug. The fungus ganoderma will also quickly kill trees."

"Riyadh","Ruellia tuberosa","description","Popping Pod is an erect, herbaceous perennial, native to Central America, named for its habit of dispersing its seeds from pods when they burst open. In its habitat, it grows on woodland edge and meadows on loamy, in wet soils on the edge of rivers, as well as on wasteland. Not very common in Arriyadh, it is being seen more and more in parks and gardens. It is a fast-growing, dense subshrub with many hairy stems, growing up to a height of 80 cm. The simple, linear leaves are opposite and elliptic; the stem is quadrangular and often purplish-black. Its fleshy, rhizome roots help it to spread vigorously. Violet-blue flowers are produced prodigiously throughout the year. They are funnel-shaped and up to 5 cm long. The ripe brown fruits, up to 3 cm long, are capsules, each with 7–8 seeds that explode with a bang when wet, hurling the seed away. Plants require full sun to light shade, and well-drained, sandy soil. Leaves may be blackened by frost in Arriyadh, but they will grow back again. Plants require regular irrigation, although some drought is tolerated. Propagation can be carried out by division, seeds and cuttings. Popping Pod’s bright flowers and dark-green leaves make it an attractive addition to private gardens and public open spaces, where it is good for mass planting. However, R. tuberosa can quickly begin to look straggly and, with frost damage, unsightly. Although not prone to insects or diseases, it is a high-maintenance plant requiring regular trimming and cutting back in late winter to encourage new growth."

"Riyadh","Russelia equisetiformis","description","The Firecracker Plant originates from tropical and subtropical regions between Mexico and Peru. Its green stems perform photosynthesis while the foliage has degenerated to tiny, short-lived scales. It is widely distributed in frost-free regions for its year-round blooming with its peak in summer and early autumn. Reaching up to 3 cm length the tubular flowers appear mainly at the twigs’ end where they get pollinated by bees and butterflies. Seeds develop in capsules and are best harvested by imposing a bag on the branches. Sowing is one way to multiply this plant but softwood cuttings also grow easily. The latter method is necessary to achieve plants with similar characteristics as their parents. Some cultivars show flowers in yellow or cream colour. In open ground this plant forms a green fountain, when hundreds of wiry twigs sprout up and topple over when extending their length. In this manner they reach a height of 1.5 metres and 2 metres width. Its advantages are much better presented, where Russelia cascades over a wall or the edges of a raised container. It demands good drainage and takes some drought when established. Frequent irrigation and regular fertilising guarantee healthy growth and enduring blooming. Exposure to wind is accepted and Firecracker Plants take both acidic and alkaline ground. It has adapted well to the conditions in Riyadh and planted in masses it makes an attractive area cover on rocky slopes. Maintenance is limited to occasional cutting back to rejuvenate growth every two or three years."

"Riyadh","Sabal palmetto","description","The Saw Palmetto Palm or Cabbage Palm, native to Florida, is a handsome species which will grow well in a garden environment in Arriyadh. S. palmetto attains a height of 15 to 25 metres with a spherical 4 to 5-metre diameter crown, although it is slow to form a trunk. The lower part of the grey-coloured trunk is smooth; the upper part is covered with old leaf stem bases, known as boots, arranged in a criss-cross pattern. There is no crown shaft; large leaves grow right from the trunk spreading in all directions. The fan-shaped leaves are stiff, bright green to deep olive, and the spineless leaf stalk runs to the end of the blade, which is about 2 to 3 metres in diameter. Leaflets tips are split, with fibres coming off the edges. The creamy-white, fragrant flowers are small, and their long branched stems droop in clusters in mid-summer. Fruits are small, round and black when ripe. The tender terminal bud within the crown is eaten like a cabbage. Trees prefer full sun to light shade, which increases the crown of the palm. They adapt to all kinds of moist, well-drained soils, can tolerate drought as well cold weather, and are frost-hardy to –12°C. Very durable and wind-resistant, the Cabbage Palm has a strong, very deep root system and requires regular irrigation. The Cabbage Palm is propagated by seed. It is an excellent street or lawn tree, easy to care for and requires only low maintenance."

"Riyadh","Salvinia auriculata","description","Floating Ferns are tender aquatic perennials with light-green fronds. The short rhizomes creep beneath the surface while the round foliage unfolds lengthwise on top. Concave, evergreen leaves show a prominent midrib and measure about 1 cm in diameter. Stiff hairs build some sort of cage that encloses an air bubble repelling water from the surface. This way the plant floats on standing water or along banks of slow flowing streams. Different from its land-living relatives the Floating Fern grows its sori (containing the spores) on the upper surface. They are released from sporocarps that are branched like a corymb. Slowly but steadily growing the plants form dense mats that blanket the water densely about 5 cm thick. They originate from tropical America but easily naturalise in frost-free climates. These ferns are considered invasive in some regions like Australia and New Zealand. Treatment with pesticides are a challenge on water, since most substances affect fish and the ferns easily associate with other aquatic plants such as water lilies. Using this plant one should be aware that it might escape cultivation easily, although in smaller ponds in private gardens in Riyadh, they are easily controlled. The attraction of Floating Ferns are minute, exotic fronds. It grows fastest in full sun, but in Riyadh will do better in partial shade. The water should be high in nutrients, but the plants thrive in almost any environment. Propagation is extremely simple by division."

"Riyadh","Sansevieria trifasciata","description","This species is traded as Bowstring Hemp, Mother-in-Law's Tongue or Snake Plant. It originates from Nigerian woodlands and has since long been cultivated as a long-living indoor plant and as reliable outdoor perennial resisting harsh conditions. Dagger-shaped, evergreen leaves form dense clumps emerging from fleshy roots and rhizomes that spread the plant slowly. Their dark-green is mottled with very light-green horizontal lines. They may be propagated by leaf cuttings while cultivars need to be multiplied by dividing clumps. Very common is ‘Laurentii’ with yellow lines along the margin. It should not be exposed to full sunlight where the edges easily get burned. Leaf cuttings from this cultivar degenerate to offsprings with green leaves without variegation. Another popular variety is ‘Hahnii’ growing compact to about 30 cm height. The species and ‘Laurentii’ both grow to about 1.5 metre high. Plenty of light is required to induce the development of flowering stalks. They bear greenish inflorescences that release pleasant scent. Established plants take drought for weeks, but turn pale if totally neglected. The soil should be moderately fertile and drain well since over watering kills the plants quickly. Snake Plants can be used outside as accent plants in rock gardens. Being free of pests and diseases and demanding no maintenance this species and its cultivars should be used more often in Riyadh’s public and private gardens, where the will need some shelter. They earn the vernacular name Bowstring Hemp for their strong leaf fibres."

"Riyadh","Santolina chamaecyparissus","description","Santolina chamaecyparissus has the common names Grey Santolina or Abrotano Hembra. Its area of distribution includes the whole Mediterranean region of southern Europe and northern Africa. Santolina is a subshrub and herb that reaches a height of 40 cm. The evergreen foliage has a silvery colour. The leaves are linear in form, multiple-pinnately arranged, and emit an aromatic scent when touched. The Santolina is a member of the Asteraceae family, with its yellow knob-like flowers which appear in summer. Propagation is best done with cuttings. With its silver foliage, the Grey Santolina is very well adapted to heat and is also frost-tolerant, but as an evergreen subshrub that is native in the Mediterranean it requires sufficient humidity. Irrigation, too, must be moderate, with low salinity. Maintenance is low, except for pruning once or twice a year to optimise a dense growth. In landscape design, Santolina chamaecyparissus can be recommended as park planting, in private gardens, in containers and as a topiary. Santolina is at its most effective where used as a groundcover, grouped or massed planting, or as edging plant. It is also valuable in rock gardens or on tops of walls. In Arriyadh, the Grey Santolina is not seen very frequently, but it should be used more often, especially in parks and private gardens. Where it can be found, its development is satisfying. With its eye-catching foliage and bright flowers, Santolina can create appealing garden themes. The green-leaved species, S. virens, is not successful in Arriyadh."

"Riyadh","Schinus molle","description","Schinus molle, known as the Californian Pepper Tree in English and filfil-rafieh  in Arabic, has its area of distribution in the Peruvian Andean desert, Chile, Middle America and South East Argentina. It is not related to the pepper plant (Piper nigrum), but the edible, red fruits are similar to pepper corns and the tree is so called, because of their shape and taste. In fact, all parts of the tree are rich in essential oils. The evergreen to semi-evergreen tree grows to a height of 15 meters. It has an open, umbrella shaped crown with pendulous branches. The leaves are alternate and pinnate with a lanceolate shape. The white male and female flowers grow on different trees, the bloom is unimpressive, but impressive are the pinkish-red fruits, which hang in clusters of dozens of berries nearly the whole year round. Propagation can be done by seeds, cuttings and suckers. S. molle has an extensive, but flat root system which can be a problem for hard paving in the proximity. Tolerant of most soils, it requires full sun and is drought tolerant, hardy and long-lived. Foliage may be damaged by frost and also suffer from insects, nematodes and occasionally mildew. The Pepper tree comes from arid regions, but the experience in Riyadh has shown that it cannot withstand too harsh desert conditions. For example, in King Fahd Road it disappeared after planting, because it needed more humidity and shelter, i.e. no hot, desiccating winds. However, it can be recommended in specific, sheltered situations in urban areas, in parks as a specimen tree and in pedestrian precincts. Attention should be paid to the possible problems of fruit drop litter and wind damage. Because of its strong root system Schinus molle can be used on hillside planting and as a slope stabiliser. It also makes an attractive screen and provides good shade for roadside planting."

"Riyadh","Schinus terebinthifolius","description","Schinus terebinthifolius is the Brazilian Pepper Tree, and like its relative is also known in Arabic as filfil-arid. It comes originally from Brazil. It prefers humid, tropical to Mediterranean climatic zones, and is relatively successful in Arriyadh, probably more so than S. molle. The tree reaches a height of 9 metres, with a similar width. It has an open, umbrella-shaped crown. The foliage is evergreen. The leaves are alternate, imparipinnate, entire and lanceolate to ovate in shape. The small white flowers appear in panicles; from these flowers, the tree develops the typical rose-pepper fruits. Propagation can be done by sowing and cuttings. The Brazilian Pepper requires full sun, but some humidity in Arriyadh, regular irrigation and has medium tolerance to salinity, thriving on most soils with good drainage. It is, however, not absolutely hardy. It can withstand temperatures down to 5°C, but is susceptible to cool, dry winds on the outskirts of Arriyadh. The Brazilian Pepper is a good ornamental tree in frost-free regions, thanks to its lush green foliage and fruits. In Arriyadh, sheltered locations should be selected for landscape planting. It can be used in public open spaces, park planting and in pedestrian precincts. Maintenance is minimal: consideration should be given to the possible litter from fruit drop, wind damage and the tree’s invasive root system. With its dense foliage canopy, it can also be recommended as a shade tree along pathways or as a small tree for a patio or garden and a slope stabiliser."

"Riyadh","Tradescantia pallida","description","Known as Purple Heart or Purple Queen, this herbaceous plant is widely distributed for its colourful qualities. The species is indigenous to eastern Mexico, where its green foliage is flushed with red for protection in full sun. In cultivation, a variety named ‘Purpurea’ is usually found, with dull foliage in deep purple when it is grown in full sun. Less light is accepted, but the colour will fade to greenish-red. The plant blankets open areas with fleshy stems that root at the nodes to form a dense mat between 10 cm and 15 cm high, and somewhat higher where it can lean on walls or neighbouring plants. Its width is permanently spread when the twigs touch the ground for rooting. The leaves measure between 8 cm and 12 cm in length. In summer, small pink flowers are borne at the tips, which are pointed upwards. They look attractive, but do not appear in abundance. After flowering, the shoots may be pinched to encourage denser growth. In Arriyadh, the foliage is evergreen unless the site is exposed to frosts. However, plants recover from dying back when weather turns warmer in spring. In adverse conditions, the plant may also be grown in pots or containers, and makes an ideal plant in hanging baskets. It is very easy to multiply by cuttings, either in water or in compost, but it should be borne in mind that the sap may cause irritation to sensitive skin. Purple Hearts perform best in well-drained, fertile soil with frequent watering. On the other hand, they are widely adaptable, tolerating poor soil, some drought and even neglect."

"Riyadh","Stenotaphrum secundatum","description","St. Augustine Grass or Buffalo Grass, originating in South Africa, is popularly used for lawns in tropical and subtropical regions. In Arriyadh, it has proved to be excellent for planting under trees, because it tolerates shade and remains lush green during winter. The grass stolons or runners form a dense mat of leaves and flattened stems up to 20 cm high with erect, branching culms up to 50 cm; the leaves are stiff with broad, flat blades rounded at the tips. S. secundatum grows in well or poorly drained soils, from sandy loams to light clays; its habitat is on calcareous sands near the sea. Able to survive with low fertility, it requires lawn fertilising to look good. It is tolerant of soil salinity and is moderately drought-tolerant, though prefers regular irrigation. It is more tolerant of cold and frost than many tropical grasses; it is available in varieties bred for their shade and cold tolerance as well as resistance to pests and diseases: e.g. Captiva (R), Sapphire and Seville. Typically propagated by plugs, sprigs or turf, seed is now available commercially. St Augustine is excellent for private garden lawns in Arriyadh, although it is less drought-tolerant than Bermuda grass. S. secundatum is prone to a range of nematodes and fungal diseases such as brown patch, grey leaf spot, and St. Augustine Decline caused by a mosaic virus. A low- to medium-maintenance grass, it keeps down most weeds and other grasses. Extremely tolerant of mowing, it makes a good ground cover for soil conservation and sand stabilisation."

"Riyadh","Strelitzia nicolai","description","Often mistaken for banana trees, the Giant Bird of Paradise attracts pedestrians. It is also called Natal Wild Banana. Evergreen, leathery leaves emerge from an oval stem that is, in fact, a cluster of leaf stalks growing several metres tall. The huge, grey-green foliage is stiffer than banana leaves, and split along its venation. The spades of such a frond measures about 2 metres in length. In late winter, the first crested flowers appear in white, purple and blue. They are reminiscent of a crane’s head, and this resemblance lent the plant its common name. Native to South Africa and Mozambique, this plant does well in subtropical and tropical climates with no severe or prolonged frosts. It takes situations in full sun or partial shade, but should be protected from strong winds. It makes a strong accent in sheltered gardens in Arriyadh. Fertile soils with good drainage meet its requirements, together with frequent irrigation and moderate to high amounts of fertiliser. It takes some salinity and alkaline soils, but does best with high levels of humus and some acidic ground. Once established, it takes brief periods of drought. For the sake of its sculptural appearance, this plant deserves a focal location. It also forms a dense screen. In evergreen forests in the Eastern Cape, these plants attain a height of up to 12 metres. Unlike banana plants, the shoots do not die after flowering, but in time form dense clumps. Separating suckers from such a clump is the easy way to multiply this species. The black seeds may also be sown."

"Riyadh","Strelitzia reginae","description","Throughout the world, the Bird of Paradise is known for its cut flowers. It is indigenous to the Eastern Cape, South Africa, growing along rivers and close to the coast. Its stiff, upright leaves form dense clumps. They emerge from the base without any branching, creating a bouquet of exotic flowers on top of lush green foliage. The bush is about 1.5 metres high, but from autumn to spring imposing flowers stand above the leaves. A horizontal spathe resembles a bird’s head. Flowers are raised one by one from this sheath, consisting of three orange sepals and three dark-blue petals each. Pollination is by birds. Strelitzias do not have many particular site requirements. With frequent irrigation, the plants thrive in full sun, but also produce flowers in partial shade. A rich soil with loam and compost is the most suitable, and occasional fertilising guarantees vital growth of healthy leaves and flowers. Hailing from coastal regions, they tolerate some salinity in the water applied, and withstand strong winds without damage. Low temperatures are tolerated as long as there are no frosts. They make a strong accent in sheltered gardens in Arriyadh. Bird of Paradise plants flourish in containers and look well as accent plants, either singly or grouped. The spectacular flowers should be accessible to enable pedestrians to take a closer look. Sowing in spring may result in flowering offspring within three to five years. Another method of propagation is division in autumn, which is usually combined with transplanting mature clumps."

"Riyadh","Tamarix aphylla","description","Tamarix aphylla, known by its common name athel in Arabic, is a shrub or small tree native to Mediterranean climatic zones from north Africa to southeast Asia. This species, which can be found throughout Saudi Arabia, reaches a height of between 6 and 15 metres. It is a fast-growing tree, sometimes confused with Casuarina equisetifolia, since both are planted on farms in the Arriyadh region as a windbreak and to demarcate fields. Its shape is often irregular, multi-stemmed and crooked. The foliage is deciduous, and from green to light grey in colour. The leaves are imbricate, entire and squamate. The pale-yellow to pale-pink flowers appear in spring. The single flower is small, but together in long racemes the flowers stand out on the branches. The fruits are small capsules with 0.5-mm seeds. Propagation is best by seed, suckers and cuttings. Tamarix aphylla has a deep, extensive root system. It grows in any soil, especially salt marshes and sandy or silty soil. This tree is highly salt-tolerant, itself exuding salt, which accumulates in crusted layers on the foliage and drips onto the ground around the tree. Prone to leaf canker and frost-resistant, T. aphylla prefers locations next to watercourses, which improves its appearance, growth and shape. It can be planted as a specimen or dominant plant, and as a hedge. For open country, it is invaluable as a windbreak, screen and as a coloniser, for slope or river bank stabilisation, hillside planting and for environmental consolidation. In certain locations, it can become invasive."

"Riyadh","Tamarix gallica","description","Tamarix gallica is the Common Tamarisk or French Salt Cedar. This Tamarisk is also a shrub or small tree coming from Mediterranean climates of the central Mediterranean basin, northern Africa, southwest Europe and Saudi Arabia. The French Salt Cedar grows to a height between 4 and 7 metres, and to a comparable width. The plant is fairly fast growing, often multi-stemmed and crooked. The deciduous foliage is green to light-blue. The leaves are entire squamate, and their arrangement is imbricate. The whitish-pink flowers appear in summer. The single flower is 1.5 cm in size, but the flowers are arranged together in racemes or panicles, giving an appealing, delicate effect. The fruits are small capsules. Tamarix gallica is propagated by cuttings, and has a deep, extensive root system. The shrub is highly salt-tolerant and its site requirements are low. That means less demand with respect to irrigation, nutrients, as well as being both heat-tolerant and drought-resistant. Pruning is recommended to optimise growth and shape. In landscape design, Tamarix gallica can be used as specimen, dominant plant, in linear plantings. In natural garden themes such as rock or steppe gardens, it will have a light, playful effect. Tamarix gallica is not seen that much in Arriyadh, but it should be used more often, because it does not have the habit of exuding salt. It is often used as an ornamental plant because of its attractive flowers. This plant can be used in open country, as a coloniser, bank stabiliser and for environmental consolidation."

"Riyadh","Tecoma stans","description","Usually, Trumpet Bushes or Yellow Bells grow as ascending large shrubs, but may be trimmed to small trees. In their homeland, they may achieve a height of 9 metres and a width of 8 metres, but usually stay half this size in cultivation. They originate from tropical America and are grown worldwide for their bright-yellow blossom. The pinnate leaves usually show bright-green leaflets all year round. Plants survive frost down to –10°C and often recover. The scented, funnel-shaped flowers are produced in terminal racemes from autumn to early summer. Winters in Arriyadh are mostly mild enough to allow continuous flowering, and the spring aspect is delightful. Brown pods develop and split open when seeds are mature. Propagation is possible from semi-ripe cuttings in summer, but progeny may also be grown from seed. Trumpet Bushes revel in full sun and heat, but also tolerate some shade. They resist heat and do with little water once established. They grow moderately to fast, depending on the fertility of the soil, and the contents of moisture and nutrients. This plant seems to be oblivious to pests and diseases, and is adaptable to almost any condition. It can be trained or clipped to any shape desired, and looks well in containers. Potential uses are multiple as a screen, group planting or large flowering hedge along roads. In smaller gardens and in containers, the smaller form, Tecoma stans var. angustata, should be considered. This form has lanceolate leaflets with deeply serrated margins. Pruning may be done in early spring."

"Riyadh","Tecomaria capensis","description","This evergreen scrambler from South Africa and Mozambique grows long branches that need support on a trellis or a wall. In this way, it may reach up to 7 metres in height and some 6 metres in width. It does not climb by itself, so it requires some maintenance to fix the woody twigs properly. Frequent clipping even allows it to be used as a hedge. However, the effort is worth it, since the Cape Honeysuckle flowers profusely in bright scarlet over a long period from late autumn to early summer. Sometimes, yellow-flowering varieties are offered, such as ‘Aurea’. The foliage is evergreen in Arriyadh, but some leaves may be shed where frosts occur. They are pinnately compound, dark-green and shiny above. The total length varies between 8 and 15 cm, but the foliage somehow seems feathery, owing to the many leaflets with their serrate edges. Frequent irrigation and fertiliser are rewarded with vigorous growth and larger, healthy leaves. Established plants endure drought in deep, fertile and well-drained soil. Cape Honeysuckles do well in partial or full sun, and resist desert heat. They resist fumes, but should be sprinkled occasionally in dusty sites in order to reveal the lush foliage. Pruning is best done in late winter. Old stems should be cut back entirely to encourage new growth. Otherwise, the base will become unsightly, with nothing but leggy branches. Underplanting with Plumbago auriculata is also possible. Propagation is very easy by layering, separating suckers or planting hardwood cuttings in late winter."

"Riyadh","Terminalia catappa","description","The Indian Almond Tree, or lawz bajali in Arabic, is widespread in the tropics. In Arriyadh, it is not always successful, owing to low humidity, but in a sheltered environment, where other plants are irrigated, growth and foliage are much better. An ornamental tree, it grows up to 20 metres in height, with a characteristic pagoda shape, symmetrical crown and horizontal branches. The bark is grey-brown and vertically fissured; the tree has spreading, near-surface, fibrous roots. The large leaves are up to 25 cm long and 15 cm broad, ovoid, glossy dark green and leathery. T. catappa is deciduous and loses its leaves twice each year; before falling, they turn dark red. The yellowish, inconspicuous flowers with an unpleasant smell are produced on spikes. T. catappa has a red, edible fruit, when fully ripe tasting like an almond. It prefers moist, well-drained, sandy and loamy soils, but is adapted to a wide range of substrates, including saline and alkaline sands over limestone. Tolerant of periods of drought, it sheds leaves to withstand dry spells. The tree is damaged by frost. Plants are susceptible to termite attack; leaves may be attacked by various insects and larvae. T. catappa is a good species for park and garden shade, and makes a good windbreak. It needs to be pruned regularly to control its size: the main leader may be cut at the top to create a wide-spreading specimen. For a tidy appearance, the leaf and fruit litter need to be removed regularly. In suitable environments, it flourishes with minimal maintenance."

"Riyadh","Thevetia peruviana","description","At first sight this shrub is often mistaken for an oleander, which is its most popular relative. Indigenous to tropical America this plant became known as Yellow Oleander to all frost-free regions worldwide. In late spring until autumn it grows funnel-shaped, fragrant flowers in yellow, salmon or orange about 5 to 8 cm in size. Inflorescences attract butterflies and scattered blooming occurs the rest of the year. A variety called ‘Alba’ shows white flowers that contrast well to the lush green foliage. The leaves are lanceolate and often pendulous with a glossy surface measuring about 15 cm in length. Odd-shaped, bulky pods are green at first to turn red and black when ripe. They grow two nut-like seeds which readily germinate. The other method of propagation is semi-mature cuttings planted in late summer. For best appearance the soil should be well-drained and fertile with frequent irrigation. Nevertheless it takes full sun, heat, salinity and even drought. In cultivation Yellow Oleanders remain shrubs some 3 m high while they may grow as small trees to 6 m in their homeland or under ideal conditions. In some regions it is considered invasive. A very common and useful shrub in Riyadh it is easy to grow and always has a lush appearance. They can be planted in containers, as flowering hedge or trained as a specimen tree. Heavy pruning is taken and results in rejuvenated, lush growth. Wounds exude milky latex that irritates the skin. The entire plants contains toxic substances that might be used medically to cure toothache or as a purgative."

"Riyadh","Verbena tenuisecta","description","A wide range of Vervains are grown seasonally for their colourful floral display. This Moss Vervain is a ground-hugging perennial from tropical and subtropical south America with finely dissected, evergreen foliage and terminal clusters of tubular flowers. In spring, the flowers appear in hues of white, lilac, purple and violet, and in Arriyadh they often re-bloom after summer when temperatures fall. The flowers are heavily visited by butterflies. The plants thrive in fertile soils that drain well, either exposed to full sun or with some shade. With lack of light, they grow less dense, forming some upright shoots up to about 15 cm. They make excellent groundcovers to accompany roses, or for spilling over edges. In open ground, they take heat if watered frequently, and appropriate irrigation is also required to thrive in containers. The mossy covers are attractive on slopes where they contrast with boulders and upright plants. Usually fast-growing plants, they respond to ongoing drought with stagnant growth, burnt leaf edges or loss of the plants altogether. Moss Vervains do not tolerate frost, but low temperatures are accepted, sometimes leading to reddish foliage without damage. Propagation is done commercially by sowing, but is also possible by cuttings or division, since the stems root where they touch the ground. Since the plants are rarely infested by pests and diseases, maintenance is limited to weeding until the plants become established. Fertiliser is best applied by slow-releasing granules in the spring and autumn."

"Riyadh","Catharanthus roseus","description","Originating in Brazil and southeast Asia, the Madagascar Periwinkle, previously known under the genera of Lochnera and Vinca, this small, erect, bushy perennial shrub has been a reliable plant, seen in Arriyadh for many years. Available in a variety of colours from dark pink, to pink, white or white with a red eye, the showy flowers are large, flat and star-shaped. The leaves are oblong, deep glossy green with a centre vein, but the flowers are sometimes so numerous they almost seem to cover them. Quite frost-tolerant, it is said that the pink-flowering form is hardier, and self-sown plants revert to the pink anyway. Flowering throughout the year, they thrive in full sun, have a medium tolerance to salinity and are also fairly drought-tolerant. The plant is poisonous. Propagated by seed and cuttings, plants tend to become straggly and can be pruned back to the lowest leaf for rejuvenation. However, replanting every few years is recommended, since the flowering is best on younger plants. Prone to attack by white fly and other aphids, it also tends to become cholorotic. For a time, it seemed to be Arriyadh’s only flowering groundcover, since it was so common everywhere. C. roseus is, nevertheless a good groundcover, when planted appropriately – the white form with the red eye can look very attractive in a ‘white garden’ in twilight – without the need for massive numbers. It is also useful as a pot plant."

"Riyadh","Vitex agnus-castus","description","Vitex agnus-castus is also called Vitex, Chaste Tree, Chasteberry or Monk’s Pepper. It is native to the Mediterranean region, but meanwhile it can be found in warm and sub-tropical climates extending as far as southwest Asia. The shrub or small multi-branched tree grows between 1 and 6 metres high. The leaves are long-stemmed and palmate, but the five leaves are separate. Flowering is from June to November. The inflorescences are branched and spike-like, with long stamens. The single fragrant flowers are pale blue-violet, while the fruits are fleshy reddish-black salal. In former times, Vitex fruits were used as an alternative to pepper. Vitex requires full sun or partial shade; it loves moist soil and can stand high salinity. It can often be found next to rivers in the whole area of its distribution. The Vitex can stand light frost. It can very often be seen in Arriyadh, where it withstands the harsh urban conditions next to King Fahd Road, for example. It has been successfully planted in many of the Murrabba parks at the King Abdulaziz Historical Centre, and in Wadi Hanifah. However, it should not be excessively pruned; occasionally is enough. For landscape design purposes in Arriyadh, it can be recommended as a specimen, dominant plant, grouped or massed planting, and as a hedge. The bee-attracting plant can be recommended for parks, public open spaces, street planting, pedestrian precincts, as shelter, for noise protection and as a screen."

"Riyadh","Vitex trifolia","description","Vitex trifolia is also called Vitex, the simple leaf Chaste Tree. The area of distribution of Vitex trifolia is in tropical eastern Africa and the Far East in French Polynesia. This simple-leaf Chaste Tree is a heat-tolerant shrub or small tree. The tree grows to about 5 metres in height and width. It is slow-growing and develops a conical shape with open crown. The foliage is evergreen. The leaves are arranged oppositely with an entire shape, and three single leaves are together on one branch, hence the name trifolia – three leaved. Single blue-violet flowers with long stamens remain together on one 18-cm-long panicle. The flowers appear in May and remain until September. The fruits are fleshy, berry-like and green in colour. Propagation is by cuttings. Vitex trifolia has tap roots; because it originally comes from tropical maritime climatic zones, it appreciates sufficient irrigation and humidity. It is able to withstand some drought, heat and also salinity. There are two other trifolia cultivars which make very good ornamental plants: Vitex trifolia ‘Purpurea’, Arabian Lilac, with leaves that are dark red to purple underneath, and ‘Variegata’, with brindled white-green leaves. This Vitex is a good plant as a specimen, grouped or massed planting, or as a hedge. It is a bee-attracting tree that is suitable for urban microclimates, public open spaces, parks and private planting, and in containers. It Arriyadh, it can be found in many urban situations, and in Wadi Hanifah, where it attracts considerable attention."

"Riyadh","Vitis vinifera","description","Vitis vinifera is the Common Grape Vine, or in Arabic, enab. It is the basic species of vine for cultivars. Sub-species are Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera, which is used for the production of grapes, and the Wild Grape Vitis vinifera ssp. sylvestris. Vitis is indigenous to the Mediterranean region, central Europe and southwest Asia as far as Iran. Vitis is a climbing plant or liana which can develop vines up to 35 metres long. The leaves are alternate, palmate and lobed. The flowers are unimpressive in panicles, and greenish-yellow in colour; it is from these that the berries known as grapes develop. Vitis grows as a native in riparian forests, plains or hill country. The soil needs to be rich in humus, from dry to moderately moist. Irrigation should be moderate, with low salinity. Vitis appreciates a sunny location. In Arriyadh, it is often seen on farms growing on wooden frames. It should not be too exposed to intense sun. Certain sheltered locations on the wall of a building or a gazebo, where it needs some framework for climbing in partial shade, will be excellent for Vitis. Pruning is required frequently to optimise the growth and to train the plant. The fruits are sour or sweet, depending on the sun and degree of ripeness. The plant attracts birds and bees. In landscape design, V. vinifera can be recommended for shelter, screen, park planting and private gardens, courtyards or containers. Fruit drop should be considered when planning a location."

"Riyadh","Washingtonia filifera","description","This palm is grown in all frost-free climates for its tough nature and pretty appearance. The Desert Fan Palm is indigenous to northwest Mexico, western Arizona and California, where it reaches 25 metres height in favourable conditions. In cultivation, it may not exceed a height of 15 metres, but in any case the width ranges from 3 to 5 metres. It is a very successful fan palm in Arriyadh. Its large leaves consist of a strong petiole that is armed with sharp hooks along the edges, and a round blade which is folded many times in section. Often, they are divided in sections exposing fibres in between. Additionally, the tips are brushy and refer to the species’ name filifera, which means ‘ wearing filaments’. Young leaves always emerge from the crown’s terminus, unfold and slowly bend down when mature to eventually persist when dry to form an ornamental skirt which led to its other common name, Petticoat Palm. White flowers appear on stalks that are often several metres long. When pollinated, they turn into dark-brown, oval fruit. This species develops a much wider trunk than its relative, Washingtonia robusta. Hybrids may occur both in the wild and in cultivation. Desert Fan Palms take all types of well-drained soils, even alkaline and poor conditions. Overwatering may result in rotting which kills the plant. Frost and drought are tolerated, and the palm thrives in both full sun and semi-shade locations alike. Growth can be accelerated by frequent watering and all-purpose fertilisers."

"Riyadh","Washingtonia robusta","description","Mexican Fan Palms originate from the western Sonora Desert and Baja California. This species develops a more slender trunk than Washingtonia filifera, and may grow remarkably higher, to a maximum height of 34 metres. Additionally, the crown is narrower 3 to 4 metres in diameter. The leaves consist of a toothed petiole to 1 metre in length and a roundish blade that does not reveal many fibres when split by strong winds. Dead leaves drop off leaving a grey bark, but often they are cut off earlier and the leaf base may last for several years. In summer, the inflorescences may reach 3 metres in length, with an abundance of pale-orange flowers. The ripe drupes are almost black and can be eaten, although they are not worth the effort compared with true dates. The palms love the sun and take poor soils and some drought when established. They resist frost and desiccating winds as may occur in Arriyadh, and the city always has many good specimens on display. They grow quickly if watered and occasionally supplied with fertiliser. Mexican Fan Palms are popular street trees with very low maintenance requirements, and never exceed the designated width. They can be grown in containers and make attractive tufts if grouped. Sowing is the only feasible way to propagate these palms. The seeds should not be stored for long, since their high fat content results in infertility when they turn rancid. They are best soaked in water for one or two days."

"Riyadh","Wedelia trilobata","description","This herbaceous plant is one of the best groundcovers suitable for Arriyadh. Creeping Daisies originate from tropical America, including the islands where they became used to a degree of salinity. In hot and dry locations, established plants still show lush vitality, with dark-green leaves that are glossy on top. They are evergreen and have three lobes, which led to the specific name trilobata. Mats are very dense, 20 cm to 40 cm high, and spread rapidly. Areas covered will not allow any weed to peek through. Bright-yellow flowers are borne from spring to autumn. They are daisy-like and measure some 3 cm across. Seeds may be used for propagation and tip cuttings root easily in a mixture of compost and sand. Creeping Daisies tolerate poor conditions but demand well-drained soils. Occasional watering and some fertiliser every now and then will result in a healthy appearance. Maintenance is very low when the basic requirements are met. The plant performs best in full sun, while growing leggy with too much shade. It makes an ideal groundcover on slopes, and fills open ground between boulders and taller plants. Attractive arrangements are achieved in containers when the runners spill over, and the plants look well when they cascade down a wall. They are quite brittle and very sensitive to foot traffic. Frost kills the foliage and fleshy stems, but the plants recover quickly. Since the dead remnants need to be discarded, sites where plants are exposed to cold should be avoided."

"Riyadh","Yucca aloifolia","description","Yucca aloifolia has the common names Spanish Bayonet or Spanish Dagger. Its area of distribution lies in eastern Mexico, the southeastern USA and the West Indies, and its climatic zones range from Mediterranean to subtropical. The Yucca is a shrub that belongs to the palms or succulents and cacti. Yucca aloifolia grows between 2 and 6 metres high, with a spread of between 1.5 and 4 metres in width. It is slow-growing with an open crown. The evergreen lanceolate foliage is dark green to light blue in colour, while the leaves themselves are scattered and entire. The bloom appears in summer as a 30 to 60-cm panicle with single flowers about 5 cm across. Their colour is pale yellow, or white to pale purple. The fruits are conical capsules 3 cm in size, originally green and turning black with ripeness. Propagation is best by sowing and pricking, and by cuttings. Yucca aloifolia is heat- and drought-resistant. It has low irrigation requirements and withstands high salinity. In Arriyadh, it can be found growing successfully in many locations. In landscape design, it can be recommended for urban areas such as public open spaces, park planting, in pedestrian precincts and in private parks. In its use, it must be considered that the lanceolate leaves have very sharp endings so it should be planted out of people’s reach. This Yucca will be effective as a specimen, dominant or grouped plant. Even in rock or steppe gardens, appealing compositions can be created. Yucca aloifolia ‘Jewel’ has a lighter foliage."

"Riyadh","Zebrina pendula","description","The Inch Plant is a creeping or trailing plant, native to Mexico. A relatively common houseplant, it makes an excellent groundcover for gardens and grows well in shaded, humid and protected locations in Arriyadh. Growing to a height of up to 30 cm, the plant has fleshy, ovate leaves which are dark green with silvery-white stripes on top, giving an attractive zebra pattern, and magenta-purple below. Fast growing, the succulent stems root wherever they touch the soil, creating a thick mat of colourful foliage. Small, relatively insignificant, rose-pink flowers are produced throughout the year. Hardy to 0°C, the plant does best in full sunlight to keep its colour intensity, but in Arriyadh does better in light shade. It prefers a good, fertile, well-drained garden soil, which retains moisture and should be regularly but moderately watered. Fertilising every few weeks is necessary during the spring and summer. Propagated by cuttings that root easily in water, this plant can be moved in situ, since its runners cling lightly to the ground. Good for mass planting, Z. pendula will hide the fallen leaves of trees and shrubs growing above. Some maintenance is necessary to contain plants, as they tend to become invasive. Misting occasionally with warm water and pinching out the tips will improve their appearance and make the plants more compact."

"Riyadh","Zinnia elegans","description","Zinnia elegans is commonly known as Zinnia. Its area of distribution lies in central to tropical America, in areas with tropical to subtropical climates. Zinnia elegans is an annual herb. It grows to between 30 cm and 1 metre high, with a width of up to 25 cm. It is fairly fast growing. The deciduous foliage is green, and the leaves are entire, with an ovate to cordate shape. It develops 2 cm flower heads composed of tongue-like petals. The colours are highly variegated, ranging from yellow to orange and red. Flowering continues many months up to the time of frost. The fruits are achenes. Propagation is by direct sowing or self-seeding. Pruning requirements are minimal, while irrigation requirements are moderate. Zinnia elegans does not appreciate stagnant water or high salinity, but thrives in sunny locations. In landscape design, it is useful as an edging plant, groundcover, grouped or massed planting. This Zinnia is an attractive ornamental plant that creates appealing effects in urban design, as park planting, in pedestrian precincts, in small managed roof gardens, in containers and in private gardens. In Arriyadh, Zinnias make a very colourful winter display; they are often planted from November onwards in the Diplomatic Quarter, for example."

"Riyadh","Ziziphus jujuba","description","Ziziphus jujuba is known by its common names of Chinese Date, Red Date and Chinese Jujube. It is native to central China, the eastern Himalayas and Japan. It originally grew in the hills or mountains at an altitude of 1,700 metres, in dry and sunny locations. The shrub or tree reaches a height of 10 metres and a width of 6 metres. The tree has a normal growth rate and often develops multiple stems. The deciduous foliage is green; the leaves are alternately arranged, entire and ovate in shape. The inconspicuous flowers, which appear in spring, are small, 5 mm in size, and whitish-yellow. Later, the tree produces edible fruits 3 cm across, with an apple taste. With increasing ripeness, the fruits turn brownish. The seed is a small stone, like that of an olive. The Chinese Date is best propagated by sowing and pricking. The tree is thorny and has an extensive, deep root system. It otherwise has low soil and irrigation requirements, and can withstand high salinity. No maintenance is required, other than periodic pruning. This Ziziphus can be found in Arriyadh on some private farms, because of its delicious fruits. It is not as hardy and adapted to desert climates as some native species, but the fruit itself and the crop are larger. This tree can be recommended as a specimen or dominant plant, and in avenues planting. Ziziphus jujuba is a screen and shelter plant, suitable for urban areas, public open spaces, park planting, private gardens and street planting."

"Riyadh","Zoysia japonica","description","Zoysia, sometimes called Japanese lawn grass or Korean lawn grass, is a species of perennial, creeping grass native to Asia and Australia. It is widely used as a groundcover and is useful in Arriyadh in places where lawnmowing is not possible. Z. japonica is a coarse-textured and cold-hardy species with stiff, pointed leaf blades, which are smooth with occasional hairs near the base. The inflorescence is a short, terminal raceme on a spike. Growing well in moderately shaded locations, it tolerates soils from sands to clays, both acid and alkaline. Zoysia is salt-tolerant and extremely drought-tolerant, but becomes straw-coloured when very dry or after hard frost, although it turns green again with irrigation and higher temperatures. Zoysia requires regular irrigation during the summer. During dry winter months, Zoysia needs only occasional watering. Zoysia is propagated from seed, is available commercially as turf, and can also be established by planting plugs; the best time for planting is early summer. It can form dense mats, and sometimes makes little hillocks and even mounds that grow over low features. Used on golf courses, Zoysia also stops erosion on slopes and repels weeds. It makes a good lawn, but is not recommended for football fields. Sometimes chlorotic on calcareous soil, Zoysia should be fertilised monthly. Zoysia is relatively free of serious pests, although white grubs may attack turf: brown patch, rust and leaf spot diseases can cause problems, and fungicides may be needed on intensively maintained lawns."

"Riyadh","Acacia nilotica","description","Usually referred to by its synonym, Acacia arabica or sant al arabi, owing to its occurence on the Arabian Peninsula. A. nilotica var. tomentosa occurs in Saudi Arabia in wadi habitats and rowdahs on sandy and alluvial soils. Single-stemmed, this medium-sized tree with its flattened or rounded crown is easily identified by the long, flat, straight, velvety-grey fruits with up to 12 constricted round seeds, which hang like peas in a pod. Young branchlets are densely white-tomentose. The tree typically has a black bark with cracks exposing a red inner layer, which exudes a sticky, reddish resin, well known as gum arabic. The long spines in pairs are sharp, while the leaves are only quite small: fragrant, fluffy yellow flowers appear during winter until spring. Very drought- and salt-tolerant, A. nilotica is unfortunately susceptible to freezing temperatures. All parts of the tree have medicinal properties; its twigs are valued as chewsticks. Tender pods and shoots are used as forage for camels, sheep and goats. Propagated by seed, which may require scarification, direct seeding is common practice in afforestation schemes. It grows rapidly in full sun, in dry, well-drained sandy or silty soils. After establishment, irrigation can be reduced, whereby occasional deep watering will stimulate growth and deep roots. Planted as a specimen tree or in groups in a desert or extensive landscape situation, the tree, with sufficient space, makes a beautiful silhouette. Unless frequently pruned to preserve its shape, the tree becomes leggy."

"Riyadh","Aloe arborescens","description","Tubular scarlet flowers make this Giant Aloe, sabbar alo in Arabic, a striking eye-catcher in early spring. Inflorescences sprout straight up from the centre and top the plant. It eventually develops a tree-like appearance in time. Native to South Africa, it thrives well in heat and reaches 2 metres in height with an additional 60 cm in flower. Very occasionally, it may grow into a 4-metre-high tree when mature. Aloes are very tolerant of soil pH, tolerating alkalinity, but they require good drainage, often growing on rocky slopes in the wild. Too much water damages the root system. Giant Aloes will tolerate full sun, but may develop brown leaf tips if sun exposure goes hand in hand with prolonged drought. Dead leaves are retained for many years, unless removed by the gardener. Dead floral stems should also be cut off, to achieve a neat appearance. Although they survive with little water, the foliage may become dull green in extreme drought. They soon recover from discolouration when watered. Frost immediately causes damage, beginning with flabby leaf tips up to total loss in just one night. Its pointed, light-green leaves are succulent and spines are aligned along the margins. This armour should be reason enough not to place it next to pedestrian areas. Giant Aloes make accent plants in rock gardens and are easy to combine with other succulents. Being used to little amounts of soil, they make very good container plants. They are usually reproduced by offsets or seeds."

"Riyadh","Alternanthera ficoidea","description","Native to Central and South America, this is a very low, fast-growing and easy-to-grow tropical groundcover plant for certain situations in the Arriyadh region. In a garden setting with ample irrigation, the plant adds a spot of striking colour, especially if the red-leaved varieties are chosen. This is a compact, herbaceous perennial, planted for its crisped and corrugated leaves which, according to variety, may be a stunning green or red in colour. The small, pale flowers are quite insignificant, although they are in bloom all year. Relatively frost-tolerant, it is propagated from cuttings, 2 to 5 cm in length. These root quickly and are best planted in organically rich, consistently moist, but not too wet, well-drained soils in full sun, or in partial shade. Alternatively, seed can be sown as soon as ripe. As a perennial, the plants can also be divided in spring. Maintenance includes pinching stems or moderate shearing to keep the plants compact and bushy. A. ficoidea is susceptible to nematodes and mealybugs, and often becomes very patchy; spider mites should be hosed off with water and fusarium wilt is combated by reducing water and removing infected plants. Useful for edgings and carpet-bedding in beds, borders, containers, or under trees and shrubs, it can also be grown as a cool-season annual in hot climates. Good in a formal garden or for seasonal interest. Plant 10 to 25 cm apart for groundcover effect. It will need replacing after a very hard frost. If desired, feed twice weekly with a balanced soluble fertiliser."

"Riyadh","Antirrhinum majus","description","Seemingly more appropriate for a European garden in summer, this showy herbaceous perennial (Arabic name: thum as samaka) is grown principally in the Arriyadh region and other arid regions for its bright-coloured flowers and is treated as a biennial, i.e. it is sown and grown in the summer and planted out for winter colour as soon as temperatures begin to fall. In the following year, the plant begins to burn as temperatures rise again, and it is normally removed. In sheltered places, however, it may persist. Its tubular, faintly scented flowers on vertical spikes with their many different colours are striking in massed planting. There are many varieties, some over 1 metre tall, others dwarf in form. A. majus requires well-fertilised, friable, rich soil of neutral pH and a sunny position with regular watering, although the soil should be well-drained and not become too wet in winter. When planted densely, it is a good plant for the garden border. Interesting for children to watch, the plants are pollinated by bees, and the flowers close over the insects when they enter, depositing pollen on them. Propagation is by seed. As a garden plant and a perfect cut flower, it will need the usual attention to keep it flowering, such as deadheading, and they should be pinched back to encourage a bushy habit and flowers. Leaves can be susceptible to rust."

"Riyadh","Asphodelus tenuifolius","description","The Onion-leaved Asphodel, or burwaq in Arabic, is an annual or biennial herb, native to the Arabian Peninsula, northern Africa and the Mediterranean. The numerous, narrow leaves appear close to the ground, reaching a height of some 15 cm; the flower spike, looking like a candelabrum, grows up to 30 cm. The tiny, single white flowers are star-shaped with a thin, red line in the middle of each petal. They appear in spring. The fruits are egg-shaped capsules and the root system is fibrous. The Asphodel prefers sandy or loamy soil, and grows in wadis, rocky or sandy deserts. Propagation is very successful by seed, and the plant is also self-seeding. It also has uses as medical plant. The crushed leaves can be applied to ulcers or boiled in water and drunk as a diuretic or laxative. A. fistulosus is an indigenous desert plant in the Arriyadh region with usefulness for landscape design, and is a good plant for natural planting schemes in rock or steppe gardens as well as for the renaturalisation of hillsides or as a coloniser."

"Riyadh","Atriplex halimus","description","This is a tall, densely branched shrub, native to the coastal areas of the Mediterranean, which is distinguished by its silvery-white stems and round, oblong to elliptical, large, silvery leaves. Its Arabic name is qataf. Slow-growing on not too fertile, but also very alkaline, sandy or silty soil, it has a very high salinity tolerance. The plant actually draws salt out of the soil. A very wind-hardy plant, it requires full sun and tolerates severe conditions of drought, reportedly surviving several years without rainfall; frost resistance is good. A. halimus is often cultivated as forage for sheep and camels. It excretes salt through hairs on its leaves, which have a salty flavour. It is easily propagated by seed, but germination is very sensitive to salinity and, as a pretreatment, the seeds should be washed to remove salts from their surface and then soaked in water. Cuttings of soft wood, or mature wood of the current season’s growth, are also possible. Deep-rooting, the plant is suitable for erosion control of slopes and for sand stabilisation. It is also effective as an accent plant, as a contrast with green-leaved shrubs, or for creating a screen. A. halimus can also be clipped into topiary forms and makes a good barrier or low-growing hedge. Generally problem-free, little maintenance is required; this shrub is at its best when given the space to grow freely. However, to improve its appearance, for example, by cutting off the dry flowers, the plant can be cut back into old wood, from which it quickly regrows."

"Riyadh","Azadirachta indica","description","The Neem tree belongs to the mahogany family. It originates from Myanmar, but was dispersed to many tropical countries. Usually, it grows to about 15 metres in height and 10 metres diameter. Its bark is deeply fissured and dark grey in colour. Alternate leaves are pinnate, up to 40 cm long and light green; leaflets are ovate with a serrated margin. In mild winters, they may last until spring, but generally this tree sheds its foliage in Arriyadh’s climate. A. indica struggles somewhat in Arriyadh’s extremely dry air and rarely achieves the beauty of Neem trees growing in Jeddah, for example. White or pale-yellow flowers appear in spring and are slightly fragrant. Self-incompatibility hinders isolated trees to grow fruit. They may develop into round drupes that turn yellow or purple when ripe. Fruits are eaten raw or processed. Birds eat them and in this way may disperse the seeds. The tree has achieved an almost pan-tropical distribution owing to its adaptability on the one hand and its various qualities on the other. Mature Neems tolerate some frost and tolerate full sun. Any soil is tolerated, unless it is waterlogged. Neem trees are used to control erosion and to fix dunes. They are easily raised from seeds after the pulp has been washed off. Vegetative propagation is possible, such as by hardwood cuttings. Branches are easily reproduced after hard pruning. The rough wood repels insects, and resists even termites. Neem glue and neem tea are therefore ideal replacements for insecticides. Neem oil is extracted from the kernels."

"Riyadh","Blepharis ciliaris","description","Blepharis, or Eyelash Plant, is indigenous to Saudi Arabia. The common name is naghi, or shawk al thub. Blepharis is a small, thorny, fast-growing perennial herb. The branches are prostrate to the ground, and the whole plant reaches a maximum height of 30 cm. Each branch is completely covered with thorny, silver-green leaves. The blue flowers appear in spring, developing later into capsule fruits. Seeds are recommended for success in propagation, and these should be harvested in summer and autumn. B. ciliaris has a tap root and grows in stony gravel deserts. In Arabia, it is also used as a medical plant. The woody parts of the plant are burned and mixed with antimony to make a black powder, which is applied to the eyes as a cosmetic. This plant has an attractive structure, making it useful for natural planting schemes. It can be used as groundcover or in rock or steppe gardens in extensive landscape schemes. Because it is indigenous, maintenance is very low and only dry parts of the plant need to be removed from time to time."

"Riyadh","Brachychiton populneus","description","This Brachychiton is more drought-resistant than B. acerifolius. It tolerates full sun and a hot desert climate, just like in its native country, the semi-arid inland of eastern Australia. Trees are found growing there amongst rocks of granite or limestone, but also thriving in deep soil. Narrow and pyramidal when young, the plant’s name refers to the widened base of the trunk which is an adaptation for storing water during prolonged periods without rainfall. On the other hand, it responds well to irrigation by growing faster. It may reach 10 metres easily, while 20 metres are to be expected only in its native environment. Known in Arabic as boudret al afreet, it is often seen in Arriyadh, where the shiny, bright-green fluttering leaves provide a lush effect. The green bark is smooth and attractive. They allow distinguishing two subspecies; Brachychiton populneus ssp. populneus has reduced lateral lobes, while three or five lobes create the palmate leaf of ssp. trilobus. Both subspecies have flowers in light yellow with purple centre appearing in spring. Cultivars may also flower in pink or red. Stagnant water is one factor to avoid definitely, hence soil should drain well. This tree blends in well in desert landscapes, creating dense shade. Not many trees do as well in lawn areas as the Bottle Tree. The root zone should be soaked thoroughly every couple of months in summer. It survives in an urban microclimate, but the littering fruit and annoying itchy hairs limit it to area where the dry pods do not affect passers-by."

"Riyadh","Calendula officinalis","description","Marigolds, which have their origin in the Mediterranean, are easy-to-grow hardy annuals, which seed very readily and once grown are even difficult to eradicate, appearing year after year in the same spot. In Arriyadh, they make a popular garden plant, and have often been used for winter colour on roadsides. A bushy plant with bright-green leaves, which are oblong, fleshy and have a spicy fragrance, they grow from 30 to 60 cm high and bear showy, daisy-like flowers up to 7 cm across, usually yellow or orange, often double. Propagated by seed, they are tolerant of poor soil, as long as it is moist but well-drained. Planted in full sun, they need regular watering until established, and are best when given only little water after that. In the summer, they will become scorched by the sun and need renewing for a winter display: it must be said that they are not particularly hardy to frosts. Prone to attacks by aphids, occasional deadheading will improve their appearance in the garden. Apart from their landscape value as a pot plant, in gardens and winter colour in public spaces, they have no great landscape value."

"Riyadh","Calotropis procera","description","The Calotropis or Felt Plant is known in Arabic as ashar. It is indigenous in Saudi Arabia, but is also native to southeast Asia and tropical Africa. The shrub can grow to between 3 and 5 metres high, and about the same width. The fact that it is poisonous (eye and skin contact should be avoided) means that it is not often planted ornamentally. However, C. procera is an interesting plant and wrongly maligned. With its bold foliage, the leaves are light silver-green on top and velvety underneath; they are large, fleshy and ovate. The flowers are grey on the outside and purple on the inside, in clustered axillary inflorescences. The impressive fruit is a large capsule, which opens to release dark seeds with silky hairs for distribution by the wind. These unusual attributes make the shrub valuable for landscape design. Bark, roots, leaves and flowers have long been used as remedies for numerous illnesses. C. procera can be propagated by seed or cuttings. The shrub has a tap root and it grows very well in sandy or silty desert conditions. The Felt Plant can tolerate high salinity and requires no irrigation once established. It is an attractive plant for natural garden themes, in rock or steppe gardens, and as a specimen making a silhouette against a wall or in group planting. It can be used in both open desert and urban areas. C. procera plays an important role in improving soil fertility, and also improves the water-retaining capacity of soil. Maintenance measures are necessary from time to time to improve its appearance."

"Riyadh","Capparis spinosa","description","Capparis spinosa has the common Arabic names shaflah, lasaf and malat. The shrub grows slowly to a height of 1 metre. It can often be seen in Arriyadh, particularly in cracks on the rocky edges of wadis. The branches with tiny spines in pairs grow from the ground and the 2–4 cm-small leaves are alternate; they have an ovate form and grey-green colour. The flowerbuds can be pickled to make capers, used in cooking. The beautiful flowers have four petals with stamens almost as long as the petals. The shrub is propagated by seed and cuttings. Capparis decidua has a number of common Arabic names including kerda and karir. The generic name is derived from the Arabic kapar. It is a slow-growing, small tree or shrub reaching a height of 5 metres and thrives on shallow, hard soils and stony outcrops. The Capparis is native to arid zones growing on rocky, clayey and silty soils in Africa, the Middle East and southern Asia. The branches seem to be leafless, because the leaves are only 2 mm in size. The bark turns silver-grey with time, and tiny spines in pairs are distributed over the branches. The flowers are bright red and conspicuous, and appear in small groups in spring and summer. In Africa, the fruits are used for camel fodder, where it is a very popular and useful plant in agroforestry. C. decidua grows on alkaline, sandy and gravelly soils. It is well adapted to drought, fire and frost. Both Capparis species are valuable for landscape design, afforestation and planting for erosion control. Low maintenance requirement."

"Riyadh","Carpobrotus acinaciformis","description","The Hottentot Fig, or hay alam in Arabic, grows wild in South Africa. It is a coarse-textured, vigorously spreading groundcover with bold, succulent leaves. They are triangular in section, curved and up to 12 cm long. Creamy or yellow flowers appear in spring and may be seen until summer. Carpobrotus edulis var. rubescens has pink flowers that resemble those of the Red Hottentot Fig. The edible fruits are not at all as tasty as true figs (Ficus carica). Hottentot Figs expand quickly when the woody branches root wherever they touch ground. It fits in well in rock gardens, but may also be used as a ground cover next to a pool or along roads. Soils should be sandy with good drainage. Full sun is essential for healthy plants and profuse flowering. Supplemental watering is needed in summer, while heat and low temperatures are tolerated. The plants sometimes become bare when old, and must be discarded to prevent an unsightly appearance. Alternatively, cuttings may be placed wherever bare spots show up. In order to quickly cover a new area, the plants should be spaced about 40 cm apart. The fleshy foliage should never be stepped on. Cutting it back entirely usually results in the loss of the plant. In spring, seeds may be sown in warm, moist conditions. Much faster is propagation by stem cuttings that should be allowed to dry before placing them in compost. The latter method is most successful in late summer. Invasions are to be expected on disturbed sites only. Suffers from fungus disease if overwatered."

"Riyadh","Carpobrotus acinaciformis","description","The Red Hottentot Fig, or hay alam in Arabic, originates in South Africa, but is now naturalised in regions with a Mediterranean climate, where it may become invasive. It withstands coastal conditions such as high winds and salinity. Not always successful in Arriyadh, C. acinaciformis suffers frost damage during cold winters and often dieback, requiring replanting from time to time. Shoots form mats of upright, succulent leaves. The foliage is sharply angled. It is fresh green when young, turning dull green later on, and may become red with age. The pink or magenta, daisy-like flowers, 15 cm in diameter, are highly ornamental. The flowering climax is late spring to early summer, but intermediate flowers may appear all year round. A large number of seeds develop in sweet, sticky fruits that ripen from August to September when they turn yellow and emit a sweet scent. Soil should be well drained. Watering should be moderate during warm weather. In winter, irrigation should be just enough to keep the plants from withering. If conditions are suitable, the shoots keep growing without dormancy up to one metre per year. They should be protected against frost, and overwatering may also result in loss of the plant, owing to fungus disease causing stem rot. The Red Hottentot Fig does well in erosion control planting, as a groundcover in rock gardens and in all areas with low maintenance, although bare patches require replanting with cuttings. Roots may be aggressive, competing for water with shrubs and trees in the same area."

"Riyadh","Ceratonia siliqua","description","This evergreen tree, known in Arabic as carob and English as St. John’s Bread, used to be native to the Arabian Peninsula as a wild variety. The Egyptians cultivated it 4,000 years ago. Nowadays, it can be found in the Mediterranean and in southern Europe. It is, however, only seldom seen in the Arriyadh region, sometimes on farms or in sheltered private gardens, and is probably more suitable for a coastal setting. Carob is a tall shrub or tree which grows up to 10 metres high with an equal spread, and has a dense crown. It is slow-growing and often multi-stemmed. There are both male and female trees (the pods appear on the latter). The dark-green leaves are pinnate with up to ten glossy oval leaflets. The flowers appear in small clusters in late summer on pale-yellow racemes directly on the stem and branches. The fruit is more imposing, and gives the tree its name. Huge, green and later dark-brown elongated pods hang all over the tree. C. siliqua grows on sandy, limey soil with good drainage and is highly salt-tolerant. It does require some humidity, but once established it is relatively drought-tolerant, because of its deep tap roots. It is sensitive to frost. In ancient times, people in the Middle East used to weigh gold and gems against the seeds of the carob tree, which was known in Greece as keration. C. siliqua is propagated by seed and cuttings. Ceratonia is a beautiful specimen shade tree for parks and private gardens. The root zone should be thoroughly soaked once per month. All parts of the tree create litter."

"Riyadh","Chorisia speciosa","description","Floss-Silk Trees are large, winter-deciduous trees, native to subtropical South America, and tolerate some frost to about –7°C, when mature. Young trees are more sensitive to cold. They grow to about 18 metres high and about 9 metres wide with horizontal but gnarled branches that shed the palmate foliage in autumn. They are composed of five to seven oval leaflets. After the leaves have fallen, showy pink flowers with curved petals are borne with up to 16 cm in diameter. They are pollinated by butterflies and develop fruits that are reminiscent of small, brown avocados with woody rind. These split open when ripe to release black seeds that are muffled by white, cottony fibres. Like those of Silk Cotton Trees (Bombax ceiba), they are used for stuffing pillows. An edible oil may be obtained from the bean-sized seeds. The dull-green trunk is covered with grey, conical spines, giving it a decorative feature. It becomes bulky with age in its lower third, and eventually achieves the shape of a bottle. The green bark performs photosynthesis before it turns light grey when old. Established trees do well in full sun and require occasional soaking in summer. Good drainage is important and the soil should be fertile. C. speciosa is a magnificent specimen tree for parks and courtyards, where it may be protected from frosts. Its interesting trunk should be admired from close by, and not hidden by shrubs. Maintenance is minimal with occasional pruning every few years. Floss-Silk Trees are best propagated by seeds."

"Riyadh","Cupressus arizonica","description","This evergreen conifer, the form of which varies from pyramidal to sometimes rounded, reaches a height of 10 to 20 m. It is indigenous to the southwest of the USA, principally Arizona, and Central America. It is found naturally on dry, sterile, rocky mountain slopes with poor soils and on valley sides. The colour of the scale-like foliage ranges from light green to silvery blue. The
branches are dense and horizontal to the stem. Young branches have a cherry-red bark; the older bark is deeply furrowed and dark brown. Tolerant of full sun, heat and wind, with a moderate growth rate, this tree is drought-resistant when established, but thrives with a thorough soaking every month or so. It is not recommended for soils with a high water table. Sometimes planted as a windbreak, C. arizonica becomes open and unkempt as it matures, and is thus less effective as a barrier. It is also susceptible to insect attack, such as cypress bark beetle, when older or under stress. Subject to leaf scorch when grown as an ornamental in an exposed location. Often planted for a woodland or forest effect in parks, it is also useful as a space definer. Not often seen in Arriyadh, the Arizona Cypress generally requires little maintenance."

"Riyadh","Ficus pumila","description","A very common creeper in tropical countries originating in Asia, the Creeping Fig is a vigorous, self-clinging, evergreen vine that attaches itself to surfaces via aerial rootlets. Its small leaves are heart-shaped in their juvenile state, forming an interesting pattern on a wall, while the plant is still young; later, the leaves become much larger, up to 10 cm long, oblong and leathery, when mature. The vine will then cover large areas of the wall completely and quickly. A mature plant will reach 5 metres and more and develop woody branches which stand out up to 60 cm from a wall. Flowers are insignificant and rare, as are the fig-like but inedible fruits which occasionally appear on plants throughout the year. F. pumila will climb on most surfaces and is good on trellises, in shady locations especially on north- or east-facing walls, where it grows best in Arriyadh. Morning sun is tolerated. Propagation is by seed, cuttings or offsets. Best in fertile garden soil, it is sometimes subject to root knot nematodes and root rot. Frost damage is caused at –10°C, but the vine will survive with warmth radiated from a supporting wall. It requires moderate, but regular irrigation. Maintenance is low, but the plant can become a nuisance if it gets out of control and it can be difficult to remove from a wall – top-heavy plants, on the other hand, may peel away. It can be cut to the ground to encourage new juvenile growth or to prevent it becoming too invasive. The variety ‘Minima’ retains the small leaf form for a longer period."

"Riyadh","Ficus rubiginosa","description","The Rusty Fig, native to Australia, is a broad, densely shading, evergreen tree that may reach 30 metres in height, spreading up to 15 metres when mature, making huge specimen trees. It also often makes an attractive multi-trunked tree. Rather slow-growing, a buttressed trunk is eventually formed, which can reach 1.5 metres in diameter: the bark has a yellow-brown colour. Its ovate to oval-shaped leaves are 6–10 cm long: the brown, short fuzz and rusty colour of the undersides of the leaves give the tree its name. The inedible figs ripen from yellow to red. In humid climates, the lower branches of the tree form aerial roots. F. rubiginosa tolerates many types of soil, even where compacted and poorly draining, and will grow well under arid conditions. It prefers full sun, but also grows in partial shade; regular irrigation is required in summer, less in winter. Once established, it can withstand short periods of drought and frosts, and withstands more cold in Arriyadh than other Ficus species. It is easily propagated by cuttings or aerial layering. Scale insect may become a problem. F. rubiginosa is an excellent ornamental tree; however, it can be planted only in very large private gardens, owing to its aggressive root system, which can damage underground pipes and foundations. It makes a very good shade tree in parks and is tolerant of urban microclimates. It is also a valuable plant for wildlife. Trees should be carefully pruned from the outset to create a good structure: by removing some branches an open form can be achieved."

"Riyadh","Jasminum officinale","description","The Poet’s Jasmine originates from southwest Asia. It received its name from the Persian word for ‘gift from God’. In Arriyadh, it is slow to grow at first and rather frost-tender. Although it needs support like wires or a fence, it may reach a height of up to 8 metres. The glossy, evergreen foliage consists of five or seven oval leaflets and is arranged opposite along glabrous, green twigs. They last in winter and withstand low temperatures better than those of other species. White, slender buds open to produce funnel-shaped white flowers in summer. Their scent is marvellous and attracts attention immediately. Inflorescences have five corolla lobes. The soil should be nutrient-rich and well-drained. Poet’s Jasmine grows well in containers. It should be watered freely in spring and summer, but sparsely in winter. They are heavy feeders and do best with general-purpose fertilisers. Jasmines are of cultural importance as the symbolic flower of Damascus or as the national flower in Pakistan and the Philippines. Jasminum officinale ‘Flore Pleno’ grows double flowers, and there are varieties with yellow or variegated leaves which should not be exposed to full sun. They are easily propagated by cuttings in September. Another simple method is layering stems for one growing season and to separate them from the mother plant, well rooted and ready to flower within one year. Previously considered a cultivar, a large-flowered jasmine is now classified as an independent species: Jasminum grandiflorum."

"Riyadh","Lagunaria patersonii","description","Cow Itch Trees occur wild in northern Australia, in the coastal regions of Queensland, New South Wales and several islands. Hence, they tolerate very high salinity and wind as well as full sun, heat and drought. An established tree in Wadi Hanifah was neglected for years and did well without additional watering, even though it grew at the valley’s edge. Light frosts of up to –5°C are tolerated except by young plants. They grow to a medium size of oval shape and about 10 metres in height, but may reach 15 metres under conditions similar to their native environment. The leathery foliage is evergreen, entire and may reach 10 cm length. From late spring onwards, there are many pink or mauve flowers about 5 to 7 cm across. These are reminiscent of hibiscus flowers, since both belong to the mallow family (Malvaceae). The inflorescences are followed by valved capsules including many round seeds, but also tiny stiff hairs that may irritate the skin. It is therefore not a good choice in pedestrian areas, but Cow Itch Trees are excellent roadside trees that form symmetrical pyramidal crowns without pruning. They are maintenance-free and will tolerate any well-drained soil. In containers, they can grow into a shrub to some 3 metres high and may form a screen or windbreak. They are multiplied by seeds or cuttings in spring. Lagunarias are rarely infested by pests or diseases."

"Riyadh","Lycium shawii","description","Lycium shawii is called awsaj or shaz in Arabic, while the English common name is Boxthorn or Desert-Thorn. The shrub or small tree is distributed throughout the Arabian peninsula, southwest Africa and the Mediterranean basin. Lycium grows up to 4 metres high with a spread of 6 metres. It is densely branched and armed with tiny thorns. The small leaves are dark green. The 7-mm-broad, star-like white flowers appear in spring. After flowering, edible pea-size red berries develop. The plant attracts birds and bees. Lycium is adapted to desert conditions; and can withstand drought, frost, wind, grazing and heat. The demands on the soil are less; it grows on rocky clayey soil. Salt tolerance is very high. The shrub needs nearly no irrigation when once established, and has tap roots. Pruning will improve dense growth, and seeds and cuttings are used for propagation. Lycium can easily be found around Riadh. It is very useful for open country, as a coloniser, hillside plantation species, slope stabiliser and for environmental consolidation. In open landscape areas, the shrub is popular because it can be planted as a hedge or windbreak and also provides fodder for livestock. Natural planting themes such as rock or steppe gardens can be created with Lycium shawii planted as dominant, grouped plant or as a hedge. A relative of Boxthron, the Goji, became very popular, because it is very healthy, rich in vitamins and mineral nutrients."

"Riyadh","Macfadyena unguis-cati","description","This vigorous climber from tropical America can conquer large areas with its self-clinging slender stems. The fast-growing Cat’s Claw can reach 8 metres in height. It is still traded frequently under its outdated generic names Bignonia and Doxantha. Glossy, evergreen leaves are borne in pairs and end in three-clawed tendrils that adhere to most surfaces except glass or metal. Bright-yellow flowers appear from late spring to autumn. They are followed by brown, bean-like pods with seeds that germinate easily. Transplanting should be done carefully without disturbing the sensitive roots and the upright, spherical tuber. It is recommended that the stems be cut to the ground after planting, since only new growth attaches itself to supports. This radical treatment allows it to cling faster. Once established, this climber tolerates full sun, but partial shade and some drought are also tolerated, while still resulting in a lush appearance. It resists heat and frost up to –9°C. It tolerates a wide range of soils, but revels in nutritious ground with a high humus content and frequent irrigation. Maintaining this plant can cause skin irritation. Owing to its rampant growth, the Cat’s Claw needs some containment if planted next to buildings. Pruning may be necessary to keep the climber from getting too heavy. It is better located near walls or escarpments which can be overgrown. Stems without support hang down forming a curtain of filigree leaves. It is occasionally seen in Saudi Arabia, clinging even to high building facades."

"Riyadh","Portulaca grandiflora","description","Rose Moss is a low, fast-growing succulent native to Brazil, which is usually grown as an annual plant for colour displays. Tolerant of all conditions in Arriyadh, it is often seen as an edging or filler plant. Reaching only 15 cm in height, it has fleshy stems and cylindrical leaves about 3 cm long, arranged alternately, or in small clusters with pointed tips. The small, rose-like flowers, with a whorl of leaves at their base, have very bright colours and are often seen as mixed cultivars of pink, magenta, orange, red, yellow and white. The striking flowers, opening only in full sun, are in bloom throughout the summer and later, and new colours are regularly being cultivated. The plants tolerate heat and drought, but are more attractive with regular watering; overhead irrigation, which damages flowers, should be avoided. The Rose Moss grows in poor, sandy or gravelly, well-drained soils. Propagated by seed or cuttings, even chopping a plant into tiny pieces and spreading them on a sandy loam bed is possible. Pests are generally not a problem, but plants can be severely damaged by frost. Maintenance requirements are not high, except for weeding and the eventual replacement of plants. P. grandiflora is a good groundcover for small garden areas, patios, hot slopes, rock gardens and containers."

"Riyadh","Rosmarinus officinalis","description","Rosmarinus officinalis is known as Rosemary in English, and huss alban and iklil al jabal in Arabic. It is native to the Middle East, southern and southeastern Europe. Its climate zone is temperate. Rosemary normally grows close to coastlines. The name is based on this habit: ‘ros’ means dew, ‘marinus’ stands for ocean. The evergreen, dwarf-like shrub grows between 50 cm and 1.5 metres high. The shape of the shrub is often round, oval to irregular. The linear leaves are a fresh, dark green. The foliage emits an appealing spicy fragrance in its preferred sunny locations. Rosemary is a very tasty herb. The 1-cm, pale-blue, bee-attracting flowers appear in early spring and are arranged raceme-like on the branches. The fruits are brown nutlets. Rosemary requires medium irrigation, with low salinity. Propagation methods include sowing and pricking, as well as by cuttings. Owing to its natural habitat, Rosemary prefers locations with a good micro-climate and semi-humid conditions and is frost tolerant. Rosemary is best planted in groups, or in massed planting, as a groundcover or a low hedge. It is attractive in rock or steppe gardens, as well as in private gardens. In urban areas it can be used in public open spaces, parks, pedestrian precincts and in containers. Rosmarinus off. ‘Prostratus’ is the creeping variety, and it has the same requirements and habits as the main species. The prostrate form is excellent for covering the tops of walls. In the early 1980s (CE), the plant’s first use in Arriyadh was in the Diplomatic Quarter."

"Riyadh","Sesbania sesban","description","In northeast Africa, this shrub may be encountered in dry riverbeds and swamp banks along streams. The Egyptian Rattle Pod adapts to its environment by growing shrubby, as a multi-trunked tree or as specimen with a single stem. Mature plants range between 2 and 8 metres in size. Its deciduous foliage is pinnately compound, some 18 cm long, with many pairs of oblong leaflets which measure about 2 cm in length. Attractive bright-yellow flowers are borne in racemes mainly in spring, when humidity and warmth indicate good conditions both for pollinators and for the shrub. In its tropical homelands, this plant produces flowers when the rain periods start. This species flowers in deep yellow, white and in intermediate shades. After the pea-shaped blossoms are pollinated, long, narrow pods develop containing up to 50 seeds each. As with other leguminous plants, the Egyptian Rattle Pods improve the soil by fixing nitrogen and adding humus. Their foliage is used as green manure and as forage for livestock. For its attractiveness and multiple uses, this species has long been grown beyond its native habitats, spreading widely in Africa and Asia. It is resistant to stagnant water and poor soil conditions including alkalinity and high salt content. Drought will lead to dormancy. Sowing is the most appropriate method of propagation, but the hard, bean-like seeds need some encouragement through scarification. Since it is widely adaptable and tolerant of adverse conditions, this shrub can be integrated into almost any landscape situation."

"Riyadh","Tipuana tipu","description","Yellow Jacarandas are semideciduous trees from Bolivia, where they reach a height of 35 metres. In cultivation, they often stagnate at 10 metres, forming a flat crown that widens to an umbrella-like shape with age to about 10 metres in width. The foliage is pinnately compound and consists of numerous ovate, fresh-green leaflets. From late spring to early summer, clusters with golden, pea-shaped flowers are borne abundantly. They create a dense carpet when they drop, which should be borne in mind when the tree is used in parks or large gardens as an eye-catcher. They form winged pods. As a tropical native, this tree goes dormant according to circumstances rather than by season. In Arriyadh, however, the leaves are shed for a brief period in late winter to regrow a few weeks later. Prolonged drought may induce the same procedure in summer, which should be prevented by moderate watering in well-drained soil. The tree may be exposed to full sun, takes salinity and tolerates light frosts. Alkaline soils should be improved by adding compost and applying acidic fertilisers. Young trees should be pruned and staked initially to form a straight trunk. Yellow Jacarandas adapt to variable conditions and tend to escape from cultivation in semi-humid climates. They are easily propagated by seed, and require only a minimum of care once established. As shade trees, they are ideal where their dropped flowers and seed packets do not create a nuisance. Consideration should also be given to the aggressive roots, which may lift pavements or asphalt."

"Riyadh","Tropaeolum majus","description","Tropaeolum majus has several common names such as Indian Cress, Monks Cress or Garden Nasturtium. It is indigenous to South America, central Peru, Colombia, the Andes and Bolivia. Its preferred climates are from Mediterranean to tropical. The Nasturtium is a fast-growing herbaceous annual that creeps to 7 metres and climbs to 2 metres. The Nasturtium will die with the first frost, but is otherwise relatively long-lived for an annual. It is an ornamental plant that is useful as a medicinal plant and as a salad. The bloom and the leaves are very tasty with an enjoyable peppery taste. The leaves are green in colour, alternately arranged with an orbicular peltate shape. They grow up to 10 cm in length. The flowers appear in summer. Propagation is by direct sowing, or sowing and pricking. In good site conditions, Tropaeolum will propagate itself through self-seeding. Salinity should be low. It needs a sheltered location with sufficient irrigation, humidity, no stagnant water and shade in particular. In Arriyadh, it can be recommended for winter colour in sheltered situations with some shade: planting in close contact with people may be a problem, because the stems break easily. Use will be possible for urban areas, in public open space, in pedestrian precincts, parks and private gardens. It also makes a good container plant and a screen, when grown on a trellis. The Nasturtium is attractive in groups or as a groundcover or climber."

"Riyadh","Cassia italica","description","This undershrub, native to the Arabian Peninsula, has soft branches from a woody base. It is fairly common in the desert, growing on rocky or gravelly sites, and its local name is ishriq; it is also referred to as Makkah Senna in English. The leaflets in pairs are obovate to oblong and blue-green in colour. Its flowers are up to 2 cm in size with yellow petals striped with violet veins. The plant flowers throughout the year, especially in summer. The seedpods are long, papery, slightly curved and conspicuous on the plant. Ishriq is well known for its medicinal properties, and is used as a purgative and a stimulant. It is often afflicted by aphids, and the honeydew which they secrete attracts ants. It will adapt to many sites, and in hot summers its green foliage is very noticeable in a desert landscape. C. italica can be recommended for use in landscape design in open situations as a coloniser or slope stabiliser, and for environmental consolidation. It will be valuable for the rehabilitation of natural plant cover. In inner-city locations with only minimal irrigation, its foliage will make an impact by staying green throughout the year. Some tidying will be necessary. It can be considered for natural themes or in situations where other plants are struggling because of harsh site conditions such as roadside greening."

"Riyadh","Ficus pseudosycomorus","description","The Wild Fig (jumais or hammat in Arabic) is related to the cultivated fig tree and can be found in sheltered ravines and outcrops in many places in the ArArriyadh region. The tree grows rapidly to 5 metres in height with many branches from the bottom of the trunk. The dense foliage is comprised of simple, leathery, dark-green leaves up to 10 cm long. Small flowers appear from spring to early summer followed by tiny figs, which are edible and yellow, when ripe. The fruit also has medicinal properties. F. pseudosycomorus grows on rocky cliffsides, where it sends out long roots. Extremely drought-tolerant, it is also to be found at the foot of slopes in gravelly sands. The tree has a low tolerance to salinity. Propagation is by seed and cuttings. The Wild Fig is browsed by camels, so that many trees are stunted and cropped down to a low bush, where camels have reached them. F. pseudo-sycomorus has landscape value for planting on rocky slopes. It requires very little maintenance and the occasional deep watering in summer will improve the appearance of its foliage"

"Riyadh","Ficus salicifolia","description","This Ficus, native to Saudi Arabia and many parts of Africa, is known in Arabic as athab. It is found in wadi beds, on cliffsides and among rocky outcrops in the Arriyadh region, where it reaches a height of 10 metres or more, with an equal spread. The crown of this evergreen tree is rounded and the branches on the short, smooth trunk are so low that they rest on the ground. The glaucous, blue-green, narrow and lanceolate leaves, up to 17 cm long and 3 cm wide, are willow-like with pointed tips. The very small figs, borne on short stalks, turn dark red when ripe. F. salicifolia prefers the alluvial, sometimes moist, soil of a dry watercourse, but will also grow on gravelly, shallow, coarse-textured ground. It is relatively drought-tolerant and needs regular irrigation until it is established. Thereafter, deep watering in summer will suffice. Frost-tolerant, the tree requires full sun; it will also grow in the shade of a high cliffside. Propagation is by seed, cuttings or air layering. Since it is not browsed by animals, the leaves may contain a poisonous sap. The tree may become prone to scale insects. F. salicifolia has a good potential for use in landscape design in Arriyadh. It creates a lush, green accent in a desert landscape, and can be planted along roadsides. It also makes a good screen and container plant."

"Riyadh","Launaea nudicaulis","description","Launaea nudicaulis, or in Arabic safara or hawa, is a perennial herb from the sub-tropical climate zone. It is native to the Arabian peninsula, Northern Africa and Turkey. The flower stalks are greyish-green and arise from the rosette of green leaves growing flat to the ground. Leaves are lanceolate and the margins are dentate. The bright yellow flowers appear in spring and are 2 cm in diameter. The stalk with its flowers at the branch ends reaches a height of 50 cm. During the summer, this perennial is dormant in the ground and comes back with the first rain. Launaea likes sandy and silty soil. The salt tolerance is medium. This plant can be found all around Arriyadh, especially in Thumamah, because it is not browsed by livestock there. Propagation can be done by seeds. Launaea is well adapted to desert conditions, but in desert-like planting themes in landscape design it has the disadvantage that it will disappear in the summer drought. With irrigation, flowering and growth can be improved and it will not become dormant. Because of its rich flowering, it can be used in near-natural gardens, such as rock or steppe gardens, as a groundcover. Launaea attracts bees. In former times leaves were applied to reduce fever."

"Riyadh","Maerua crassifolia","description","This large shrub, growing up to 5 metres tall, known as sarh or merro in Arabic, is native to the Arabian Peninsula. Its foliage is used as fodder for camels and is a source of food in Africa, where it is made into soups and other dishes. As a widespread, evergreen, and densely branched small tree, usually with a rounded flattish crown, it occurs in drier areas with sandy, gravelly and silty soils. The intricate, glaucous, spiny branches have small simple, often dense, elliptical leaves, which are slightly hairy and about 1 cm long. Yellow-green clusters of flowers with many stamens are borne in spring and the red berry fruits are bean-shaped. The seeds were considered sacred to the ancient Egyptians and there are a number of historical medicinal uses, as well as uses in apiculture. Shrubs are tap-rooted and have a high salt tolerance. In fact, they tolerate very harsh desert conditions, are hardy and withstand wind. The leaves and fruits are palatable to all animals except horses and donkeys The sweet fruits are also used for human consumption. M. crassifolia has good potential as a native plant for landscape design: it is useful in afforestation and for creating shelter belts. Requiring only minimal irrigation, whereby deep watering will increase growth, this is a low-maintenance plant."

"Riyadh","Ochradenus baccatus","description","Ochradenus is an indigenous plant from the Arabian peninsula. The Arabic names are kardhi or alandra. The plant can be found growing wild all over Arriyadh and the Arriyadh region. The shrub can grow to a height of 3 metres. The stems are fresh green; the leaves are small and inconspicuous. However, the attractive blooms that appear in spring are in 4 cm long panicles with 4 mm yellow single flowers. The fruits are in 3 mm white berries in panicles. The plant is very well adapted to desert conditions, with its tap root and small foliage. It likes silty, rocky soils. Kardhi can withstand high salinity. Propagation is by direct sowing or sowing and pricking. Maintenance is very low; pruning will optimise growth and flowering. As a native plant, Ochradenus can be used in open country, as a bank and slope stabiliser, coloniser, and for environmental consolidation. Its use is advisable for rehabilitation of plant cover, because of its windbreaking properties. This shrub is also suitable as a hedge and groundcover, and is therefore a good shelter for other plants. The plant can be used as fodder for camels. However, Ochradenus should be considered in urban planting themes as well. In harsh urban conditions, it will provide green foliage where other plants are unable to grow, and it is also a very useful plant in natural schemes such as Wadi Hanifah. In former times, it was used as medicinal plant; a decoction was used for wounds, intestinal parasites and to relieve pain."

"Riyadh","Pulicaria crispa","description","Pulicaria crispa is indigenous to Saudi Arabia, and is distributed nearly all over the entire Arabian peninsula. However, it is distributed in Africa as well, where it can be found along the Sahel zone. In Africa, it is used as fodder plant and as a remedy. In the Sahara, an infusion for drinking is made from this aromatic plant. The resulting drink has a gingery taste. In Arabic, P. crispa is called jisjas or sabat. Jisjas is a fast-growing bushy, annual or perennial desert plant. It grows like a small dwarf shrub between 40 and 50 cm high, and with numerous branches emanating from the base. The foliage is a fresh olive-green. The alternately arranged and sessile leaves are pubescent. The flowers appear in spring in 8-mm yellow knobs with an aromatic scent. The fruits are 2-mm achenes with small hairy tufts. The roots are lateral and tap-rooted. Jisjas likes sandy and rocky locations and is highly salt-tolerant. This plant is a native, and very well adapted to harsh desert conditions. It can withstand hot winds, desiccation, heat and poor soils. Maintenance or irrigation is not necessary after planting out in the location. Propagation is by direct sowing or by cuttings, and probably by self-seeding. Pulicaria crispa is a very useful plant for the rehabilitation of natural plant cover. It can be used in seed mixtures for areas that should be recolonised, or for environmental consolidation. But in natural garden themes such as rock or steppe gardens, too, it will be effective as groundcover, grouped or massed planting."

"Riyadh","Reseda muricata","description","Reseda muricata is distributed on the Arabian peninsula and the Middle East. In Arabic, it is called dayl al kharouf. In Saudi Arabia, it can be found along the West Coast, Hejaz and on the East Coast up to the central regions. Reseda muricata is a perennial, biennial and in some regions only annual herb. It is a fairly fast-growing plant and looks like a dwarf shrub. It reaches a height of 40 cm and a spread of up to 50 cm. The lower leaves are entire lanceolate, while the upper leaves are ternate. The foliage is grey-green. Flowering begins in summer, with long yellow-whitish racemes about 10 cm long. The individual flowers are 4 mm in size. The fruits are capsules with serrated pits. The root system is lateral and deep. Propagation can be done by seeds. R. muricata is an indigenous plant and is very well adapted to harsh desert conditions. The herb is highly salt-tolerant. Maintenance requirements are very low after establishment, and irrigation will improve a good development of the plant. The use of dayl al kharouf in landscape design can be seen in the rehabilitation of natural plant cover, which means it can be considered for open country, as a coloniser or slope stabiliser, and for environmental consolidation. Reseda will grow as a groundcover and as grouped planting. And even for natural garden themes or parks like Wadi Hanifah, it will provide a pleasing display. In the extensive landscape surrounding Tuwaiq Palace in the Diplomatic Quarter, some specimens can be found which were distributed by self-seeding."

"Riyadh","Rumex vesicarius","description","Rumex vesicarius is known in Arabic as humeidh. This annual herb is native to the Arabian peninsula and can be found throughout Saudi Arabia. The annual is fast growing and reaches 50 cm in height and width. The shape is that of a dwarf shrub, regular and upright. The fleshy leaves are green ovate-triangular. The leaves are edible. The pale-red, raceme-like flowers appear in spring. In full sun, the winged bloom becomes dark red. The 5-mm seeds grow inside the winged flower. Propagation can be done by seeds. Humeidh grows in silty, loamy soil, and has a lateral root system. Branches are fragile and may need wind protection. It is quite tolerant to salinity and needs moist soil. After rainfall in late winter and spring, it is very widespread in Arriyadh and the surrounding area, lending desert landscapes a soft reddish bloom. On the escarpment of the Tuwaiq Palace in the Diplomatic Quarter, it has spread by self-seeding, and provides a very attractive sight in the spring every year, especially after rains. With increasing heat, Rumex will vanish during summer until the following winter or spring. For landscape design purposes, Rumex is useful in open country as a coloniser and slope stabiliser. Because it is native in the Kingdom, it is valuable for the rehabilitation of natural plant cover. In seed mixtures, it will support natural soil preparations in its pioneering function. Rumex is valuable as a groundcover and bedding plant in urban situations, and has potential for use as an annual for street planting in winter."

"Riyadh","Withania somnifera","description","Withania somnifera has several common names such as Indian Ginseng, Winter Cherry and, in Arabic, sum al far. It is a perennial or better shrub that is distributed within India, Africa and the entire Arabian peninsula. In Indian Ayurveda medicine, it is a popular remedy, and the name means something similar to sweaty horse, based on the flavour of the roots. Sum al-far grows up to a height of 150 cm and attains 1 metre in width. It is fast growing and develops a conical dense crown. The deciduous foliage is green with oppositely arranged leaves. The leaves are 10 cm in size, and ovate. The bloom is very small, and whitish-green. The flowers appear in summer. The fruits are roundish berries, 5 mm in size, with a bright-red colour. Propagation is by direct sowing. Soil requirements are low, with the plant growing on sandy or silty soil. W. somnifera can withstand temporary droughts, but also grows in moist soil. Irrigation is not required after establishment, but growth will be improved with some watering. Salinity should not be greater than medium. Sum al far is not very hardy, which means that it will die back in strong winters. In Arriyadh, it can be found in the Wadi Hanifah lake area, where it grows next to the shore in sheltered situations with some shade. For landscape design purposes, it can be recommended for situations such as a coloniser in open country as groundcover and as a small hedge. However, with its fresh dark green foliage, it will also be pleasing in sheltered private gardens and courtyards."

"Riyadh","Ziziphus nummularia","description","Ziziphus nummularia has the Arabic names sidr, nabak or bayyi. Its area of distribution is the northern to central Arabian peninsula, western India and southeastern Pakistan, and southern Iran. The shrub is used to desert climates. It normally reaches a height of 2 metres, or sometimes more. Ziziphus nummularia develops a dense, thorny, often irregular and weeping crown. The foliage is evergreen. The leaves are alternately arranged, entire and small ovate. The 3-mm single flowers stand together umbel-like and appear in winter and spring, and have a whitish-yellow colour. The apple-like fruits have a size of 1 cm. Propagation is by seeds and cuttings. The shrub, as a native, is very well adapted to desert conditions, with its tap roots, leathery leaves, drought resistance and high salt tolerance. It grows in silty, gravelly soil. The sidr is an attractive and appealing shrub or small tree which can be found growing in small groups in Thumamah Park. It is recommended for use in open country and would be excellent for projects such as the rehabilitation of natural plant cover. It can be used as coloniser, bank and slope stabiliser, and for environmental consolidation. With its fresh dark foliage, it should be also considered for urban landscape design purposes. It would be advisable for natural landscape design themes such as Wadi Hanifah or even in road verge greening, park planting, or as a screen or shelter against wind. Pruning is not necessary, but periodic pruning and irrigation will improve growth."

"Riyadh","Adenium obesum","description","Desert Roses, or adanah in Arabic, are succulent shrubs with irregular shapes, native to northeastern Africa and Arabia. Their fleshy trunks may be buried half or entirely in the soil. They grow slowly to several metres in height with large caudexes. Twisted branches are sparsely covered with obovate, shiny leaves that are up to 8 cm long. They are semi-evergreen and retained in warm conditions. In Arriyadh, they usually undergo dormancy and drop their leaves in winter. Irrigation should be reduced at this time. Most showy are the stellate flowers in shades of pink and magenta with white throats and a diameter of 5 to 7 cm. They appear in dense clusters in spring until temperature exceeds 40°C. Desert Roses do excellently as indoor or container plants when they receive enough sun and not too much watering. Cuttings root easily, but do not develop the typical fat, bottle-like trunks. Young plants already produce flowers after one year. In rock gardens, Adenium takes full sun and thrives on heat. Pruning usually does not improve the plant’s appearance. If cuts are necessary, they should be done only during the dormancy in winter when the flow of sap is low. The sap is poisonous and is sometimes used on arrows for hunting big game. Decoctions are medically used to treat eczemas and infected wounds. Cultivars also show flowers in deep-red or white. Adenium obesum is the most attractive of twelve species; some are considered subspecies."

"Riyadh","Eriobotrya japonica","description","Eriobotrya, commonly known as Loquat, is an evergreen shrub or small tree with a compact, rounded structure that reaches a height of between 3 and 8 metres. It is indigenous to Central China and South Japan, and seen in Arriyadh only in sheltered gardens and farms. The bark and young branches are woolly and the large, deep-veined and saw-toothed leaves are glossy, dark green on top and rusty underneath; they are elliptically shaped and up to 30 cm long. Clusters of small, white, rose-like flowers appear at the branch endings in panicles in autumn and winter, exuding a scent of vanilla. The small, edible, round fruit is deep-yellow in colour, and sweet in flavour. The large seed can be squeezed out of the fleshy fruit. Loquat is deep rooting and likes well-drained, but moist soil, and is nevertheless quite drought-tolerant. Growth rate and salt tolerance are moderate. E. japonica can be propagated by seed or cuttings. It is an appealing, small tree for a protected, private garden or patio or a large container, because of its attractive foliage, flowers and fruit. Best planted in wind-sheltered locations, Loquat will make an excellent specimen, dominant or edging plant in a park, too, if sheltered. It requires a rich dressing of fertiliser in spring, and is susceptible to fireblight, root fungus and mealybugs. Maintenance is moderate and pruning is required from time to time to improve the tree’s shape and to thin out the interior branches, to allow sunlight to reach inside. In this way, fruit-bearing will be increased."

"Riyadh","Asclepias curassavica","description","The Milkweed or Silkweed is a small, bushy, evergreen shrub with woody stalks at the base, growing to a height of 100 cm. It is indigenous to tropical North America and Africa. Silkweed has umbel flowers both red and yellow in colour that bloom almost the whole year round. It requires a moist, fertile and well-drained soil and nutrients. A. curassavica prefers a sunny to a partially shady location. It can withstand frost up to –5°C. The Silkweed takes its name from its seeds. When the longish slender pods open, dark brown seeds become visible which have silky hairs upon them. The plant can be propagated by seeds or cuttings of the green branches or root division. The milky fluid produced in the plant’s stems can cause irritation, and contact with the eyes should be avoided. This Asclepias is very attractive in private gardens or parks in mixed borders, or as a high groundcover, because of its attractive appearance in both flower and seed. It should be planted together with other plants having similar requirements such as regular irrigation, light and nutrients. Lush, tropical planting themes are, therefore, suitable for the use of this plant. Pinching the tops after flowering improves blooming and encourages dense growth from below; otherwise, the plant needs only low maintenance."

"Riyadh","Pittosporum tobira","description","Pittosporum tobira is also known as Mock Orange. The shrub is native to central China, Japan and Korea. It prefers a Mediterranean to subtropical climate. It grows to a height of between 2 and 5 metres, with a spread of up to 4 metres. The shrub is usually regularly rounded in shape, and the foliage is evergreen. The leaves are dark green on top and light green underneath. The leaf shape is convex-obovate and entire, and the leaves are arranged alternately. The flowers are white or pale yellow, with a pleasant fragrance. The fruits are pale olive-green round capsules with a size of 1 cm. Maintenance requirements are minimal; occasionally, pruning will lead to a denser growth. Propagation is by sowing and pricking, by cuttings or through self-seeding. Mock Orange does not like stagnant water; however, it needs medium irrigation with a low salinity content. Like all evergreen plants which grow in Mediterranean climates, P. tobira loves a microclimate with sufficient air humidity. Accordingly, it is vulnerable to desiccation. It is, however, frost-tolerant. This bird- and bee-attracting plant will provide shelter and screens in parks or private sheltered gardens. Pittosporum can be pruned as a topiary, and is useful in pots. Considered should be the fruit drop which is maybe not desired next to pathways. The shrub will be a recommended as dominant plant or as grouped planting and also as a flowering hedge. Occasionally seen in Arriyadh, in the Diplomatic Quarter for example, P. tobira often shows signs of sunburn and chlorosis."

"Riyadh","Faidherbia albida","description","The Ana Tree, formerly known as Acacia albida, and in Arabic as harraz, is native to Africa and introduced into the Middle East, India and Pakistan. It is a large, very thorny, deciduous tree reaching 30 metres in height in its native habitats on floodplains and dry watercourses. A fast-growing tree with a thick trunk and zigzag branching habit, the pale grey-green leaves are borne on whitish-grey, smooth stems and branches when young, which become grey and rough when older. The straight, whitish thorns are up to 40 mm long. The bark is grey, and fissured when old. Scented, pale cream-coloured flowers in long spikes occur from March to September, and are followed by large, unusually twisted, fruit pods, bright orange in colour. F. albida has a deep tap root, making it very drought-resistant, and it will grow in waterlogged soils and withstand occasional frost. For propagation, its seeds should first be treated with boiling water overnight before sowing. Young plants develop long tap roots and should be planted in the ground quickly. The tree is particularly useful in nitrogen fixation and erosion control, and is highly valued in agroforestry. It also has medicinal properties in the treatment of infections. Susceptible to mealybugs and scale, it can be treated with systemic insecticides. Large areas of the Sahara in Niger have been re-afforested with the Ana Tree, with great success. With its white twigs and thorns, it is an interesting specimen tree in a park or large garden with only low maintenance requirements."

"Riyadh","Acacia cuthbertsonii","description","This bushy, often gnarled shrub or low tree has a twisted trunk with highly fissured bark, which flakes off in brittle pieces. The yellow flowers appear profusely after copious rainfall. Commonly known in its native Australia as Silver Witchetty, A. cuthbertsonii occurs sporadically throughout arid parts of the country, usually growing on the gravelly soil and rocky sands of hills or along creeks and drainage lines. It requires full sun and is very drought-tolerant. Such topographical situations are similar to those of the shallow wadis and rowdahs of the Arriyadh region, where water collects after winter rains. These properties have made the tree attractive for planting in the Arriyadh region and it was selected from several Australian species for trials at the Research and Agricultural experiments Station in Dirab, Arriyadh, where it has grown well in certain experimental studies. For landscaping purposes, the tree’s dense foliage make it an ideal low shrub for accent and screening. The large seed pods are eaten when still green by aboriginal people, and the bark is used as an aid against toothache and for making bandages and sandals."

"Riyadh","Acacia gerrardii","description","A. gerrardii is a variable species. The variety iraquensis (sant al waraqi) has a rough, spiny trunk and finely fissured, dark-coloured bark, which does not peel off in strips like that of the whitish bark of A. gerrardii var. najdensis, (sant al najdi). The seeds of iraquensis are held in sickle-shaped, flat pods which are beige-coloured, long and straight, and covered by fine, grey hairs. Those of najdensis are strongly curled, almost circular pods, and a much darker brown. A. gerrardii has a distribution in the northern part of the Arriyadh region and Saudi Arabia and is usually found in depressions and watercourses. A small tree with ascending branches and a flattened crown. It has a long, straight and single stem with a reddish bark. Young, strong branches are densely covered with grey velvety hairs. Numerous thorns are arranged in pairs and white in colour, while mature trunks are almost thorn-free. Singular, round, creamy-white, sweet-scented flowers appear from October to February. During a very cold winter, the tree is deciduous. Propagated by seed, A. gerrardii is fast-growing, hardy to about –10 °C, and drought-resistant. It will become a spreading shade tree, when watered frequently. Its winter flowers make the tree an attractive species for arid landscape design in both intensive and extensive landscape situations. It is suitable for most gardens with a native look, and valuable for revegetation schemes, and roadside planting. Little maintenance is required once trained well into a straight leader."

"Riyadh","Acacia iteaphylla","description","This is a beautiful, slightly weeping, tall shrub, widespread in its native Australia. Its habitat there is amongst tall trees, growing in gravelly soils, sand and clay on gentle slopes and wasteland or in undisturbed natural vegetation. It has high potential for planting in Arriyadh. The shrub has an angular, branching structure with drooping tips bearing narrow, willow-like soft phyllodes or leaves, distinguished by their silvery blue-green colour. Stems and leaves are reddish-pink when young. Profuse, pale yellow sprays of fragrant flowers emerge from October onwards until early spring, from conspicuous red bracts. It is a very adaptable shrub, tolerating most soils and lime. It is also very tolerant of extended dry periods, moderate frosts up to –10°C, and also saline soils. A. iteaphylla grows in full sun, even tolerating partial shade, and needs a well-drained position. No irrigation is required once established, but watering is necessary over long dry periods. The shrubs attract birds and are aromatic. Propagation is by scarifying the seed or boiling it in water. Plants flower well after two years. Low maintenance is required, branches do not resprout after pruning. An annual application of a slow-release fertiliser improves growth. A. iteaphylla has a high landscape value. It makes a good screen or low windbreak, and can be planted as an ornamental feature or an interesting hedge. A prostrate form can be used as a mounding ground cover. In the garden, A. iteaphylla is an acacia which provides colour during the winter."

"Riyadh","Senna occidentalis","description","This medium-sized shrub originates from tropical America. It grows slender twigs with compound, dull-green leaves to a total height of some 2 metres with an equivalent width. The alternate, evergreen foliage is compound with elliptical leaflets of 2 to 10 cm that may exhibit a reddish venation. From autumn until spring, yellow-orange flowers emerge in terminal racemes with up to six florets each. They resemble pea flowers measuring about 3 cm across, and attract bees and butterflies. Seeds ripen in cylindrical, glabrous pods of 12 cm in length. Their colour varies from olive-green and brown to almost black, and they can be used for propagation after being soaked for 24 hours. When roasted, they can serve as substitute for coffee beans, hence the common name Coffee Senna. Another common name, Septic Weed, indicates that it occasionally escapes from cultivation found on disturbed ground such as waste sites or ditches along roads. In Arriyadh, this can be excluded beyond irrigated areas, while in humid tropical countries they compete with crops. If bruised, this plant exudes a foetid smell. Plants are poisonous, but rarely ingested by livestock. Any soil with sufficient moisture is suitable, and the shrub benefits from fertile ground with high nutrient levels. It thrives in full sun to produce a stunning floral display. Under adverse conditions, Coffee Senna is short-lived and even grows annually in some regions. With respect to its proliferating habit, this shrub is useful in low-maintenance areas. It rarely suffers from disease."

"Riyadh","Cercidium floridum","description","Native to the Sonoran and Mojave deserts of Arizona and California, Cercidium species are not only some of the most drought-tolerant of trees, but are also outstanding flowerers, deserving to be used much more prominently in Arriyadh. Not often planted in Saudi Arabia, C. floridum is nearly always mistaken for the very common Parkinsonia aculeata (Jerusalem Thorn), which in many ways is quite similar. However, with careful observation, it is noticeable that the smooth, bright-green bark of Cercidium is different to that of Parkinsonia. C. floridum is to be found in the central median of the King Khalid International Airport highway. This slow-growing tree reaches a height of 9 metres with equal spread, and is deciduous in dry and cold spells. When it loses its fine-textured foliage, the dense, green and spiny twigs give it the appearance of an evergreen. Fragrant masses of bright-yellow, pea-shaped flowers are a wonderful sight covering the whole tree in spring. They are followed by pods. The blue palo verde withstands great heat and intense sun; drought-tolerant once established, deep watering on a regular basis during the growing season encourages faster growth and spectacular flower displays. It tolerates alkaline soils and is moderately frost-tolerant. It is propagated by seed, which germinates readily once the hard seed coat is scarified. Blue Palo verde is a beautiful, small shade tree providing stunning spring colour. It is useful for road and footpath planting, and as an accent in gardens, courtyards and parks."

"Riyadh","Malvaviscus arboreus","description","Known as Wax Mallow or Turk’s Cap, this shrub spread from Central America across all warm climates, and is grown in containers where winters are cold. It grows at moderate speed to form a round shrub some 2 metres across, eventually reaching double this size if conditions are ideal. Wax Mallows resemble low Chinese Hibiscus, except for their flowers that seem to remain closed, giving them the other common name Sleeping Hibiscus. The protruding carpel is cloaked by bright red petals forming tubular flowers from spring until late autumn. Seeds develop in inconspicuous capsules and may be used for propagation. Much more common are softwood cuttings to multiply the shrub. The evergreen leaves are trilobed with a serrate margin. Usually bright green, they immediately indicate malnutrition such as alkaline soil by turning yellow. Fertile, well-drained soil with frequent irrigation allows locations in full sun, but this shrub also thrives in partial shade. It takes pruning to achieve a neat appearance and readily regenerates after severe cutting back. Pinching the branches during the growing season encourages compact growth and the production of flowers. Low temperatures are tolerated without any damage. Wax Mallows are reliable shrubs in small gardens and pedestrian precincts, and are often seen in Arriyadh in mixed shrub borders. They may grow in groups or as a flowering hedge in open ground or in containers. Copious amounts of flowers are produced, but also litter, demanding an appropriate location or frequent cleaning."

"Riyadh","Rhazya stricta","description","Rhazya stricta has the common Arabic name of harmel. It is an evergreen shrub growing about 1 metre high. This native shrub is distributed over the Arabian Peninsula. The numerous branches lie close to the ground. The leaves are alternately arranged, lanceolate and about 10 cm long. The foliage is very dense and leathery. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae, and is poisonous in all parts. But, it was used as remedy for sore throat and fever. The small, white, star-like flowers appear in summer. After flowering, the plant develops small pods with black seeds. Propagation is by seed. The plant is very well adapted to harsh desert conditions with its strong foliage, tap roots and high salt tolerance. It grows on sandy or silty soil. Rhazya stricta can frequently be found in Arriyadh and its surroundings. With its dark-green foliage, it is eye-catching and a welcome sight in the harsh sunlight of the desert landscape. After long droughts, it may look a little straggly, because some evergreen leaves will dry out and become brown. Even so, however, it can be recommended for use in landscape design in open situations as a coloniser, a bank and slope stabiliser and for environmental consolidation. It is valuable to restore natural plant cover. In inner-city locations with some irrigation, it will not dry out, and the foliage will remain green. Some pruning will be necessary. It can be considered for natural themes or in situations where other plants are struggling because of hard site conditions, e.g. roadside greening."

"Riyadh","Sesuvium portulacastrum","description","Sesuvium, or Shoreline Purslane, is one of those plants that is somehow introduced into a country, adapts quickly and is then seen everywhere. A sprawling, perennial herb, native on four continents, it has been seen increasingly in Arriyadh over the past ten years, and has become one of the toughest groundcovers there. Prostrate, up to 30 cm high, its stems extend up to 1 metre long, with smooth, fleshy, glossy-green, lanceolate leaves. With its many branches, rooting at the nodes, one plant will form a mat up to 2 metres in diameter. The small, pink flowers have green sepals on the outside and are pink on the inside. They flower all year round; the fruit is an inconspicuous capsule. Very fast growing, they thrive on wet to moist, saline and nutrient-poor soils, with or without humus; saltwater tolerance is extremely high. Drought tolerance is equally high and, once established, the plants require virtually no irrigation, although watering once or twice during the hot summer will result in better ground coverage and appearance. S. portulacastrum needs full sun and is relatively frost-tolerant in Arriyadh. It is easily propagated by cuttings and seed. Pests and diseases have not been reported. With its spreading mat of greenery, S. portulacastrum is something of a lawn substitute, providing instant green cover, especially good for roadside planting and medians. It is also an important sand stabilizer. Generally maintenance is very low, but plants are not very resistant to trampling, so that weeding a large area is difficult."

"Riyadh","Cassia javanica","description","The Apple Blossom Shower, or khiyar baladi in Arabic, is a deciduous, flat-topped tree with pinnate leaves. It grows comparatively quickly to 15 metres or more, and has a canopy of a similar size. The branches droop gracefully and may even sweep the ground. Oblong leaflets are some 5 cm long and arranged even-pinnate on midribs of up to 70 cm in length. It is not easy to trace back the natural area of distribution, because this tree has long been planted for ornamental purposes. Java and Sumatra would appear to be their native islands. Not often seen in Arriyadh, where frosts may lead to severe damage, their natural habitat ranges from evergreen or deciduous forests to savannah-like habitats. For a period of about six weeks, showy pink, slightly fragrant flowers appear on racemes in spring while the twigs are still bare. Numerous flat seeds mature in pods that may reach 60 cm in length. This tree may naturalise where its requirements are met. Propagation is common by scarified seeds. They may also be used for medicinal purposes as a laxative, but can also cause emesis. Its reddish wood may serve for construction purposes. A number of subspecies are cultivated in tropical climates. Cassia javanica ssp. agnes is a highly ornamental subspecies with larger flowers. It is suitable for urban areas and may grow along roads as long as the pods do not litter trafficked areas. Wind exposure may damage the brittle branches. Chlorosis often occurs as a result of iron deficiency. Pruning is best done at the end of spring, after flowering."

"Riyadh","Moringa oleifera","description","The Drumstick or Horseradish Tree is an erect, fast-growing tree with open branches and a graceful appearance reaching up to 10 metres in height. Native to India, it is characterised by its thick, dark corky grey bark, delicate foliage and beautiful, fragrant flowers. The distinctive, bipinnate leaves up to 40 cm long have widely spaced, oval, clear green leaflets on short stalks. Attractive whitish-yellow, highly scented flowers are borne in loose clusters covering the whole tree in spring and early autumn. The fruit, up to 50 cm long, is a bright-green, ridged pod containing many seeds, which are a popular ingredient in curries. The tree grows best on a dry sandy soil and has a high drought resistance. In Arriyadh, it requires regular irrigation and a sheltered microclimate with a humid atmosphere. Propagation is from seed and cuttings. The Horseradish Tree is useful in many ways: its name is derived from the roots, which taste like horseradish, and the seeds yield oil for machinery, salad oil and soaps. The bark contains a coarse fibre for making mats, paper and cordage. The branches are used for fodder. M. oleifera makes an ideal shade tree for courtyards, patios and small gardens. Undemanding, it requires careful pruning: branches can be brittle and are planted as a living fence. It is not susceptible to pests or diseases. A wild shrub form growing in rocky wadi sides is M. peregrina (al ban in Arabic): up to 3 metres high, it has profuse flowers, is drought-tolerant and has good potential for garden cultivation."

"Riyadh","Paspalum vaginatum","description","Bahia Grass or Seashore Paspalum is a warm season turf grass, native to South America and growing in tropical areas throughout the world. It is a very useful ornamental lawn grass for Arriyadh. Spreading by rhizomes, Paspalum grows even where drainage is a problem. The leaf blades are flat, 5 mm wide and greyish-green. It requires full sun, sandy soils and ample irrigation, even though it has some drought tolerance. Paspalum does not produce highly viable seed, and therefore must be propagated vegetatively by stolons, rhizomes. It has the highest salt tolerance of all turf grasses. Regular leaching will alleviate the buildup of salts in the soil. Research has indicated that saline water could be used as a selected herbicide. Paspalum will also tolerate recycled effluent water, as opposed to Bermuda grass, which begins to suffer as salts build up. In lawns, it has high shoot densities and is therefore more competitive against weeds than other grasses. Few pests attack Paspalum. It requires much less nitrogen than other warm season grasses and is tolerant of a wide range of pH. Paspalum is shade- and drought-tolerant. It can be overseeded with cool season grasses and mown very closely. Paspalum is a useful plant in sand dune stabilisation. It is, however sensitive to cold temperatures, becoming dormant at 10°C. There are several varieties of Paspalum vaginatum. Environmentally, Paspalum requires less water, fertiliser and pesticides than other warm season turf grasses, but needs the usual maintenance procedures for lawns."

"Riyadh","Peltophorum pterocarpum","description","Bearing names such as Yellow Poinciana, Rusty Shieldbearer and Copper Pod, this is a showy, flowering tree, native to tropical Asia and Australia, and introduced to the Arabian peninsula. Not often seen in Arriyadh, where it may lose its leaves during a long dry period, the leaves reappearing quickly with the flowers. It grows rapidly to 20 metres high and 10 metres wide, and has an umbrella-like crown with fuzzy, rusty-red twigs. The rich green, bipinnate leaves are about 60 cm long with oval leaflets. Bold, yellow, nocturnally fragrant flowers, with crinkled petals, each with a brown spot, are borne on spectacular, upright racemes about 45 cm long, blanketing the tops of trees. Large bunches of the copper-coloured fruit, containing flattened, oblong seeds, are attractive at first, but later look untidy because they remain on the tree for months. P. pterocarpum requires light shade to full sun, and cannot tolerate heavy frost. It is very salt-tolerant, preferring moist, well-drained, sandy soil. Being drought-resistant, irrigation requirements are moderate. Propagation is by seed, which needs to be scarified. Yellow Poinciana is an excellent shade, street tree and a specimen tree, if plenty of space is available. It needs regular pruning, when young, to keep the tree dense and in shape. Care should be taken not to plant it too close to structures and hard paving, since the trees have shallow root systems. Generally pest- and disease-free, this is a low-maintenance tree, which may create a leaf litter problem, if not kept neat."

"Riyadh","Jacquemontia pentantha","description","This fast-growing, freely flowering climber is an easily maintained vine, originating in tropical America. It is now seen in Arriyadh’s gardens, where it has proven to be resilient to the strong sun, and makes a very attractive plant for covering fences and trellises. Its twining stems are relatively thin; the lush shiny, green leaves are small and heart-shaped with pointed tips. It bears smallish, brilliant blue flowers for most of the year, which are bell-shaped with a lighter coloured throat and produced in clusters at the ends of stalks. J. penthanta requires full sun or partial shade, and prefers fertile, non-saline sandy soils that are well drained. Its somewhat fragile stems necessitate wind protection. This scrambling vine is not drought-tolerant or frost-tolerant, and needs regular irrigation. Propagation is by cuttings or by layering. It is not prone to insect infestations. As a creeper with controllable growth and neat appearance, only occasional light trimming is necessary. Heavier pruning will encourage new growth and produce flowers on new branches. It will grow well in a container and the beauty of its blossom is best admired on a shade structure or trellis."

"Riyadh","Calligonum comosum","description","An almost leafless, evergreen shrub with many stiff, upright branches, this plant is widespread in the desert and arid zones of Saudi Arabia, where it is known in Arabic as abal or arta. It is characteristic of deep sand, has a very long tap root reaching down to the water table and helps to stabilise the surrounding dunes. It is often seen growing in a hummock with the sand collected around it: it also occurs in plains and wadis, and is cultivated around desert plantations as a windbreak. Its abundant, yellowish-white flowers appearing in spring are not only attractive, but also edible and have a sweet scent. Relatively high, its fragile twigs are slender, the leaves tiny and the pretty, red, oval fruit is covered with hairy spines. It is fast-growing on sandy and gravelly soils and rock, and is very hardy with a high salt tolerance. Important for grazing, it is browsed by camels. It features frequently in the folk medicine of the desert owing to its food value, high in sugar and nitrogen. It is used for gastric, ophthalmic and stomach problems, as well as for hair scenting and dying; the dried leaves and stems are used to treat toothache. Propagation is by seed or cuttings. The vertical structure of C. comosum is extremely interesting for landscape schemes, although with age the plant tends to fall over and become untidy. It is a useful plant for sand dune stabilisation, hedges, massed planting and in the foreline of afforestation. Maintenance is low, and in extensive landscape schemes the plant will look after itself."

"Riyadh","Haloxylon persicum","description","This tall, spineless shrub, known as ghadha in Arabic, is a native plant in Saudi Arabia with a range covering saline deserts in the northern part of the Kingdom. An evergreen bush with slender branches, it reaches a height of 2 metres and the insignificant, yellow flowers reduced to anthers appear in summer. The plant is tap-rooted and prefers light sandy and loamy, well-drained soils; it will also grow in nutritionally poor soil under very alkaline and saline conditions. It requires full sun and can tolerate drought. Propagation is by seed; it is occasionally infested by insects. H. persicum, together with Calligonum comosum, are two important indigenous shrubs in the desert, supplying firewood and fodder for local populations. They are also extremely important in sand dune fixation and environmental improvement, but their numbers have begun to disappear with over-exploitation and destruction of their natural habitats. In addition, extremes of climate, overgrazing by livestock and browsing retard the shrub’s growth rate. Furthermore, natural regeneration is impeded, when the seeds of the plants become deeply buried in sand, impeding germination. H. persicum is a useful plant which should be planted more often, owing to its usefulness in dune stabilisation, afforestation schemes and windbreaks. Slow-growing, it has minimal irrigation and maintenance requirements."

"Riyadh","Rhanterium epapposum","description","Rhanterium epapposum is known locally as arfaj. It is native to the Arabian peninsula and Kuwait, where it is that country’s national flower. Arfaj is a bushy dwarf shrub with a round regular shape growing to between 40 and 80 cm high. The branches are silvery white, and the leaves are small, lanceolate and with small spikes. The leaves are arranged alternately. The small yellow flowers appear in spring. The fruits are numerous, and each contains six to eight seeds. They are distributed by wind or water. The seeds stay dormant in the soil until conditions arise which are optimal for germination and growth. The shrub has long tap roots. It grows in silty, sandy and gravelly soil, and is highly salt-tolerant. All these characteristics are indicative of the plant’s extraordinary adaptation to the harsh desert conditions. Arfaj can be found very often in and around Arriyadh, where it is grazed by camels. It is one of the characteristic plants in this region. No maintenance is required following establishment. Because it is an indigenous plant, Rhanterium is highly suitable for the rehabilitation of natural plant cover, it is very valuable in the open country as coloniser, bank stabiliser and for environmental consolidation. It can be used as a groundcover or in grouped planting. In natural locations, however, it will propagate by self-seeding. It is also effective for natural themes such as Wadi Hanifah. With some irrigation, the foliage will remain green on the shrub in summer."

"Riyadh","Salvadora persica","description","Known in Arabic as meswak or arak, this is the shrub that provides the twigs used as a natural toothbrush. Native to the Hejaz and extremely well-adapted to arid conditions, meswak is widespread, salt-tolerant and very drought-resistant. It is found where groundwater is available, in wadis, in seasonally wet sites, and along drainage lines. S. persica is an evergreen, slow growing, small tree or shrub up to 6–7 m high with a crooked, many-branched trunk, and fissured, whitish bark. It has a wide crown of green, crooked branches, and the twigs have a pleasant fragrance. The elliptic to almost circular, rather fleshy leaves have a high salt content and are light to dark green. The small, greenish to yellowish flowers, borne in loose, slender-branched panicles are up to 10 cm long. The edible, spherical, fleshy fruit is 5–10 mm in diameter, bright red when ripe and has a sweet, aromatic taste. S. persica prefers sandy soils and areas with high groundwater. Drought-tolerant, deep irrigation in summer will serve to improve the shrub’s appearance. With its high salinity tolerance, it has great potential for reclaiming saline soils. Leaves make good fodder for livestock, since they have a high water content and are rich in minerals. Grown in plantations or hedges, S. persica coppices well and is excellent as a shelterbelt, windbreak and in sand dune reclamation. It is prone to some pests and diseases, e.g. Cistanche tubulosa, a root parasite, and also defoliating insects. S. persica is an excellent desert shrub, requiring no maintenance."

"Riyadh","Zygophyllum coccineum","description","Zygophyllum coccineum has the Arabic names humaz, batbat and r’utrit. Its area of distribution is the northern and central Arabian peninsula, Egypt, the Middle East, western Asia, and Pakistan. It is a small desert shrub growing to between 50 and 75 cm high. The plant is a succulent (cacti type). It has a shape like a dwarf shrub, prostrating and irregular. The evergreen foliage is olive-green to silvery green, and the succulent leaves are opposite and tomentose. The tiny, delicate, yellow flowers appear in winter and spring, and have long stamens. The fruits are egg-shaped capsules 2 mm in size. Propagation is best done by seeds. Z. coccineum has tap roots, grows on sandy, silty soil and is highly salt-tolerant. It can be used as a groundcover or grouped plant in natural design themes such as rock or steppe gardens, and can be found very often on abandoned land and in open country surrounding Arriyadh. As a native, it needs no maintenance and is highly recommended for the rehabilitation of natural plant cover. It is valuable in seed mixtures together with other native shrubs for renaturalisation projects. It is useful in open country as a coloniser and for hillside planting, slope stabilisation and environmental consolidation. Another bonus is that humaz is not grazed by animals. It is also recommended for natural design themes, such as in Wadi Hanifah, where it can be found already, having propagated by self-seeding."

"Riyadh","Acacia ampliceps","description","This tall shrub or tree, recently introduced in ArArriyadh, is native to Australia, where it grows along watercourses or in swales and drainage lines in hilly country on heavy, sometimes saline, alkaline soils. Such topographical situations are similar to those of the shallow wadis and rowdahs of the Arriyadh region, where water collects after winter rains. In fact, the tree can withstand dry periods of up to nine months. Acacia ampliceps is a fast-growing but relatively short-lived species with a life span of usually not more than 50 years. It has a spreading habit with canopy stems branching from the ground. Sometimes, the plant is almost prostrate. Pendulous branchlets have thin, light-green, lanceolate phyllodes. The flowers are in white to cream, with globose heads. For a while, there was a confusion of this species with A. salicina. Highly tolerant to salinity, the tree is, however, frost-sensitive. The foliage can also be susceptible to insect attack. Propagation is by seed. Where coppicing is necessary as a maintenance measure, the tree responds well. For landscaping purposes, the tree’s thick foliage makes it an ideal plant for screening, while the prostrate form makes for a good groundcover shrub. Unfortunately, it sends up many suckers, limiting its use near a lawn, for example. Regional studies have shown that A. ampliceps has great potential for use in the reclamation of sabkah areas, as a low windbreak, in dune rehabilitation and erosion control projects. It is also suitable as fodder in arid areas."

"Riyadh","Citrus limon 'Trunj'","description","This variety of the lemon tree is also known locally as trunj, and is probably the hybrid named 'Ponderosa': it is often seen on farms in the Riyadh region. It is, however, relatively frost-tender and the trees may be damaged by drying winds or prolonged cold. Bearing highly ornamental fruit of extraordinary size of more than 20 cm, twigs may be bent down by the weight of many huge lemons. The tree grows fast up to 3 metres high, bears fruit early and has an angular shape with large leaves. It can be trained on a trellis to stabilise the branches and to prevent damage. Young plants are delicate and cannot compete with weeds. 'Trunj' requires a well-drained, sandy and fertile soil, with regular watering until established. Complete NPK fertilisers should be applied in early spring. Citrus trees have the attractive tropical feature of producing flowers and fruit at the same time. The fruit does not have any particular commercial value, but the non-acid lemons have a thick, bumpy rind that can be used for producing jam. The rind is low in essential oils, but gives off an aromatic scent and is sometimes candied or preserved in brine. Pruning should be limited to removing water sprouts, usually the result of severe cutting back of the branches of older trees. Most of these shoots are short-lived anyway and leave unsightly sticks on the branches. Deadwood might be provoked by prolonged drought or waterlogging. Like all citrus, the trees suffer from attacks by mealybugs, aphids and often have mildew."

"Riyadh","Heliotropium crispum","description","This woody shrub, called rumram in Arabic, is common on sand and limestone in the Arriyadh region, and is well known for its medicinal properties for healing mouth and skin infections and curing snake bites. Widespread, it is found in sandy wadis, rocky terrain and on poor pasture ground. A perennial up to 50 cm high with many white, bristly stems from a woody base, the small, linear leaves are grey-green. The flowers are white with a yellow centre growing in a zigzag fashion down one side of the stem. Deep-rooting, it is very tolerant of saline conditions. The plant is extremely tolerant of drought, wind and hot sun. It attracts many insects and is the food plant for moth caterpillars. Propagation is by seed. H. crispum is a useful plant for landscape purposes as a low ground cover. It must be noted, however, that some maintenance is necessary, since the plant becomes untidy over time: watering in summer will improve its foliage and appearance."

"Riyadh","Ipomoea batatas","description","This vine produces edible tubers that can be oblong, round or even forked, and up to 25 cm long. Their skin may be white, yellow, red, brown or purple. Varieties with white flesh are firmer, while those with shades of orange are more nutritious, containing the vitamins A and C. Originally grown by Inca and Maya tribes in Central America, it was Columbus who began to distribute the plant. Nowadays, it is a staple food found in many tropical countries. It is eaten boiled, baked, fried, grilled or raw as a salad. Sweet Potatoes are also grown as pretty ornamentals for their attractive foliage, which is deeply lobed or heart-shaped. Cultivars show different colours such as purple, and are sometimes variegated. Flowers appear in shades of purple, pink or white from spring until autumn, but they are rather inconspicuous. Being of tropical descent, the plant revels in heat and full sun if the soil is fertile, well drained and not too dry. Although it may be grown from seed, it is usually propagated by softwood cuttings or tuber sections. Maintenance requirements are low, limited to training the shoots along the support. Pruning is possible at any time, and infestations by pests or diseases are rare. Sweet Potatoes become dormant during prolonged periods of cold, but remain evergreen in mild climates without frost. In Arriyadh, this plant is grown for its ornamental foliage, and large areas are often seen as a groundcover. It may also be planted in containers, hanging baskets or to hang over walls."

"Riyadh","Lasiurus scindicus","description","Lasiurus, or Sewan Grass (daah in Arabic), is a perennial, bushy desert grass that grows between 30 and 60 cm high. In good conditions, it reaches a height of 90 to 100 cm. It is distributed in the Arabian peninsula, and is indigenous to the Arriyadh region as well as in North Africa, India and Pakistan. The linear leaves are silver-green-yellow, and the flowers appear in early summer in 10–14-cm long and 1-cm-broad silver-silky spikes. This grass has deep roots and prefers a non-alkaline sandy soil. Propagation is done by sowing and pricking out. L. hirsutus is highly drought-tolerant, and withstands hot winds. Fertilisation is not necessary. All of these attributes make it a very useful plant for landscape design in and around Arriyadh. With its attractive spiky flowers and its compact growth, pleasing compositions can be created. L. hirsutus can be planted in open country as a coloniser, slope stabiliser for hillside plantation or for environmental improvement. Even for cultivated urban areas, however, it may be used in planting schemes for public open spaces, parks, street planting, car parks, pedestrian precincts and containers, as well as in private gardens. Native grasses should be planted more in landscape design, because they are very well adapted to desert conditions. In masses or planted in groups, the attractive effect of a wavy sea is created when the wind blows through them."

"Riyadh","Portulaca umbraticola","description","Purslane is a common annual herb, native to the southwestern United States, which is a somewhat weedy species of the desert at higher elevations. It is sometimes confused with Portulaca oleracea, or common Purslane; P. umbraticola is easily distinguished by the prominent margin on the fruit capsule. A succulent, low-growing prostrate plant up to 15 cm high, the leaves are green, linear in shape, and the ascending stems are fleshy, hairless and often reddish in colour. The red flowers are 2 cm across with rounded petals, yellow at their base. They are in bloom from spring to autumn, but are open only part of the day. A wide range of flower colours of cultivars are available: in the Yubi series, there are eight clear colours: white, yellow, light pink, pink, rose, red, scarlet and apricot. They are followed by seed capsules encircled by crown-like, pale green, translucent, wings. P. umbraticola thrives in hot, dry conditions and spreads rapidly to become 50 cm across. Plants will reseed themselves in late spring; they are killed by the first heavy frost. A slow-release fertiliser in mid-summer or fertilising every two weeks is necessary. Extremely drought-tolerant, they require only very moderate watering to look good. They will grow in either average to poor, well-drained garden soil in full sunlight. Maintenance is high with weeding and replacement: in midsummer, plants can be cut back by about 50 percent to encourage new growth and more flowers. When mass planted, P. umbraticola makes a dramatic impact in desert gardens."

"Riyadh","Prosopis farcta","description","This low, perennial shrub, sometimes referred to as Syrian Mesquite and known locally as yanbut, has a wide range of habitats all over the Middle East through to India on sandy plains, disturbed ground, fallow fields, borders of springs, and along farm fences and canal banks. Seen throughout the Arriyadh region, it forms straggly, prostate bushes, primarily on wasteland. The spiny, older stems become grey, almost white in colour. Multi-branched up to 2 metres high, it has alternate, compound, bipinnate leaves and small, white glabrous flowers in spikes up to 10 cm long from April to August. The striking legumes are oval, kidney-shaped, dark-chestnut-like pods, swollen to 5 cm in length. Sometimes a striking orange, they become almost black, like a lump of charcoal, when ripe. P. farcta will grow in salty and non-salty habitats on poor and good soils, and is very drought-tolerant. Propagation is by seed and cuttings. Normally, plants will be browsed only by goats. Although the Syrian Mesquite has been classified as a noxious weed in some countries – it is even widespread in Arizona – it has some merit as a native plant in sand stabilisation schemes and afforestation in the first row. In extensive landscape designs, no maintenance at all will be necessary."

"Riyadh","Santolina rosmarinifolia","description","Santolina rosmarinifolia is a slow growing subshrub and herb that originally comes from the Mediterranean, northwest Africa, Portugal and central Spain. It is called by its common name Lavender Cotton or Olive Herb. The evergreen foliage is deep green. The leaves are lanceolate and entire, and alternately arranged. As the name says, its leaves are comparable with Rosmarinus officinalis. The pale-yellow, knob-like flowers, appear in summer with a size of about 1 cm. The fruits are 0.1-cm nutlets. Propagation is by sowing and cuttings. The herb requires medium irrigation with low salinity. S. rosmarinifolia prefers penetrable, limey soil, and a sunny location. Because of its evergreen foliage, it grows better in locations with sufficient humidity. Maintenance is low: once in a while, pruning is required to create a compact shape. In landscape design, it can be used as a groundcover, in groups or massed planting, as a low hedge or border plant, and also in rock or steppe gardens. This bee-attracting herb will be effective in urban areas, park planting, public open spaces, in pedestrian precincts, private gardens, in containers and as a topiary plant. It is rarely seen in Arriyadh, and is not used as often as its relative, Santolina chamaecyparissus. It can be recommended for sheltered garden areas because of its fresh appearance and spicy fragrance."

"Riyadh","Tamarix nilotica","description","Tamarix nilotica is known as Nile Tamarisk or Manna Tamarisk, in Arabic athel, abal or tarfa. The name Manna comes from the fact that insects would suck the sap of these Tamarisks, and then excrete the honeydew-like substance as part of their metabolism. These sweet Manna balls were used by the Bedouins as nourishment. They also had a medicinal use as an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial agent against throat and gum inflammation. A shrub or small tree, its area of  distribution lies in the Arabian peninsula and northern Africa. The preferred locations reach from Mediterranean wood- or shrublands up to extreme deserts. The slow, irregularly growing tree reaches a height of 8 metres. It is often multi-stemmed, and the foliage is grey-green. The leaves are squamate. The purple flowers stay in panicles together. These panicles are usually 10 cm long. Flowering lasts very long. The fruits are capsules. Propagation is by direct seeding and by cuttings. Tamarix nilotica can withstand high salinity. It has no special requirements in relation to soil or irrigation. It is adapted to the desert, with its hot winds, droughts and heat. The Manna Tamarisk is useful in open country as a coloniser, bank stabiliser and for environmental consolidation because of its invasive roots. The small tree is attractive in groups or massed planting. Woodland edges, pond or stream edges, as in its natural habitats, will be the best recommendation for its use in landscape design, for example in Wadi Hanifah or the Al Hair Lake Area."

"Riyadh","Terminalia arjuna","description","The Arjuna Tree, native to India, is a tall, deciduous, tree up to 25 m high, often with a buttressed trunk, the bark of which is grey or pinkish-green, smooth and peels off in thin strips. Found growing in several locations in Arriyadh (e.g. behind the Hotels Intercontinental and Khozama), it is not readily identifiable for most people. It is also very similar to T. elliptica. Arjuna has a wide crown with drooping branches. Its leaves are hard, simple, opposite, and elliptical, up to 9 cm long, often with crenulated edges: trees are sometimes leafless before late-spring flowering and new leaves appear in late winter. The small, cup-shaped, creamy or greenish-white and strongly fragrant flowers are borne on small terminal spikes up to 13 cm long. The dark brown, oblong, woody fruits with stiff, narrow, striated wings take nearly a year to ripen. Initially a slow-growing tree, the Arjuna has a shallow root system. In its native habitat, T. arjuna grows on most soils in ravines or in dry watercourses, becoming very tall on fertile alluvial loam. Tolerant to salinity and drought, regular irrigation is, however, required in Arriyadh. It will withstand cold winters, but is sensitive to hard frosts. Propagation is by seed, root suckers, and air-layering. T. arjuna is suitable for planting on saline, alkaline soils and deep ravines, and is a useful park tree and background tree in a large garden. Apart from tidying leaf litter and occasional deep watering to improve appearance, little maintenance is necessary."

"Riyadh","Thalia dealbata","description","Native to tropical America, the Water Canna or Alligator Flag is a perennial, aquatic plant for shallow water or the margins of ponds and lakes. An emergent, broad-leaved plant with rosettes of leaves on narrow stems, T. dealbata can reach a height of 2 metres. The large, long-petioled leaves, as wide as 45 cm, are alternate and sheathed with broad, lance-shaped, and veined leaf blades. The bold, dramatic foliage is reminiscent of Bird of Paradise leaves. The lavender-purple flowers are gracefully borne on open, bracteate, dangling clusters on very long, thin stems throughout the summer. All parts of the plant are covered with a white, powdery coating. A further species, Thalia geniculata, is slightly smaller, and has characteristic red stems at the base. The Water Canna is best in full sun; in Arriyadh, a position in partial shade is better. Plants are not frost-hardy, so that the plant will die back in very cold weather, and re-emerge in the spring. Propagation is by seed or root division. Pests include aphids. A robust, tropical plant, its natural habitats are lakes, swamps, and rivers. T. dealbata is most commonly cultivated for large ponds or the edges of lakes. It will also look well in a large water jar. Maintenance and fertilising are necessary to keep the plant in good condition."

"Riyadh","Nelumbo nucifera","description","Native in most countries of Asia, the Lotus plant with its large, showy, water-lily-like flowers, is an aquatic perennial, and is planted in the soil of a pond or lake with its leaves floating on top of the water. It is found in Arriyadh only in sheltered gardens with some shade from the sun. This is an iconic plant which creates a beautiful aspect when in full bloom. The flowers rise on thick, long stems up to 40 cm above the water. Its leaves often reach a height of about 150 cm and may be as large as 60 cm in diameter, while the showy flowers can be up to 20 cm in diameter. The beautiful and fragrant flowers, ranging in hue from white to hot pink, open in the morning and petals fall in the afternoon. The leaves are sometimes, and flowers always, raised above the water surface. The fruits are conical capsule with openings looking like the rose of a watering can, and are also decorative. When the seeds are ripe, the pod tips them through the openings into the water. The Lotus grows best in calm, fresh water: it requires many nutrients good garden; non-manured soil is suitable. Fast growing, the Lotus is best contained in a large pond in deep water, but it is also very effective in a large water jar. Propagation is by seed or root division. As in its native countries, the leaves of Lotus will turn brown after frost, but the plant is not damaged and revives in spring. Maintenance is moderate, if a tidy effect is desired it becomes intensive, and plants must be fertilised during the growing season."

"Riyadh","Pontederia cordata","description","Pickerelweed, an aquatic or marsh perennial plant originating in tropical America, usually grows to a height of about 1 metre. It has spread to many countries and climates throughout the world, and is a good bog margin plant for ponds and lakes in Arriyadh, where it is not sensitive to frost, unlike many aquatics of the tropics. The plant is composed of a cluster of large, erect, lance-shaped or heart-shaped leaves up to 20 cm wide and 35 cm long, growing from a single basal clump. Terminal spikes of pretty, violet-blue flowers, 15 cm long, appear from May to October. P. cordata should be planted on the edge of a garden pond or water garden in full sun or light shade. To stop it spreading in a small pond, it can be planted in a container, and then stood in shallow water on the edge. Individual flowers last for only one day, and the entire spike will last for several days. Pickerelweed is highly susceptible to black fly. Fertilising is not necessary, since there will be sufficient nutrients in the water. Propagation is by easy division of the rootstock of large plants. Maintenance measures include tidying the plant to improve its appearance and occasional limiting of unwanted growth."

"Riyadh","Cymbopogon citratus","description","Lemon grass is a perennial, native to India, which has become very popular as an aromatic herb
in cooking, and in the production of perfume. This lemon-scented grass is also versatile in the
garden and is now seen often in Arriyadh, where it has been planted as an ornamental. It grows
in dense clumps up to 1.8 metres in height and about 1 metre in width. The strap-like leaves are
bright bluish-green, and release a citrus aroma when crushed; they have gracefully drooping
tips, making them interesting in garden borders. Typically without flowers, flowering produces
inflorescences that have a nodding appearance in the wind. An attractive groundcover when
planted in gravel mulch or next to a pathway, plants release their fragrance when brushed against
by passers-by; they also grow well in containers. Lemon grass is not frost-tolerant, but will come
back when cut to the ground. It is said to keep away mosquitoes. C. citratus needs full sun to light
shade with a moist, well-drained soil. Plants are drought-tolerant, but suffer without watering. As
fairly aggressive growers, they need to be divided, which is the usual method of propagation in
spring; alternatively, they can be seeded. The roots are deep and strong, making plants suitable
for erosion control and slope stabilisation. Cymbopogon schoenanthus, or Incense Grass, is a
native Najd desert species, which also contains aromatic oil. Growing in dry, stony places, it can
appear dead during the summer; after winter rain, it comes back to life and waves its flowers in
the breeze."

"Riyadh","Pyrostegia venusta","description","In appropriate locations, the Flame Vine may present its vigorous growth with lush, evergreen leaves. In its native country, Brazil, it climbs fast by twining or tendrils to a height of 24 metres under perfect conditions, but is limited to about 14 metres in cultivation. The tendril is a modified leaflet at the tip of a compound leaf which twines around anthropogenic structures such as a fence, or a natural support such as trees. Such overgrowing may result in invasions that kill shrubs or small trees in the vicinity. In its homeland tropical South America, where no frosts occur, dormancy may be induced during a brief period of dryness. Twigs take some frost, but protected sites are recommended initially, especially in Arriyadh. Plants recover readily after hard pruning, which is best done after flowering. Most striking is its spectacular flowers that measure up to 8 cm across. Abundant clusters of bright-golden or orange flowers show up mainly in early summer, and sporadically throughout the year. They are tubular, curved and waxy. They are followed by pods of 30 cm in length. Flame Vines do best in full sun with moderate to abundant watering, and respond well to fertiliser. They can be trained along a pergola, but should be allowed to drape over structures, since the best effect can be achieved when the flowers hang down. They are most often multiplied by layering and cuttings. They can also be propagated at a small scale by separating suckers."

"Riyadh","Agave sisalana","description","In its shape this agave resembles A. americana though the leaf edges do not show sharp spines and the narrower foliage is not bent downwards. However, the tip is just as dangerous to anyone nearby. It does grow faster and develops a short, thick trunk. Flowers are creamy white. The genus' name derives from the Greek agavos which means 'admirable'. Easily grown in all arid regions, and as with many other desert plants, agaves do not like fertilisers and prefer soils with low organic content. Water logging in pots or rock may kill agaves. Healthy specimens are usually pest free, but mealy bugs or scales can easily be washed off the huge leaves. The flowering stem is stunning, but results in a dead foliage clump that needs to be disposed of carefully. However, offsets make new plants easily. Plants do not flower before the age of 10, but may take up to 30 years before doing so and dying. This species produces tough fibres that are used for matting, twine, sandals or brushes. Sisal for rope is probably the best known product. Native Americans made also medical use of agaves. Other species of agave suitable for planting in Riyadh, or occasionally seen there, are: Agave colorata; Agave palmeri; Agave parryi spp; Agave weberii."

"Riyadh","Acacia karroo","description","Endemic to southern Africa, A. karroo has been selected from the exotic acacias as having potential for planting in Arriyadh. Typically a shrub, it will grow into a medium-sized tree under good conditions and grows rapidly with regular water. Variable in shape and size, it has a rounded crown, branching from the lower part of the trunk. The bark has deep fissures and is red on young branches. Fragrant, yellow flowers, opening in clustered heads in late spring. Narrow seed pods are flat, straight or curved. A. karroo is a pioneer tree with an ability to fix nitrogen, but it is relatively short-lived (up to 40 years). The tree is deciduous in cold areas and prone to frost damage. It has a long taproot, but its roots are invasive; planting near paving/foundations should be avoided. Propagation is by seed soaked in hot water and left overnight; young trees are best fertilised with compost and bonemeal. A. karroo grows in most free-draining soil types, in full sun or partial shade. Drought-tolerant, the root zone should be deep-watered every one to two months during the summer. A beautiful patio-sized tree for the garden, its bright yellow flowers against dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark are highly attractive. Useful for erosion control, as a windbreak, thorny informal hedge, or barrier. Maintenance includes careful training of the leader, gradual removal of side branches until all are above head height, so that the long thorns are no problem, and also spring pruning of dead wood. The tree is prone to attack by mealybugs."

"Riyadh","Alcea rosea","description","The Hollyhock is a biennial or perennial plant originating in China and southwest Asia. It is a good structure plant for a sheltered garden border in Arriyadh, where it will grow best during the cooler time of the year to a height of over 2 metres. A. rosea has an upright, candelabrum form: its hibiscus-like flowers usually appear on long spikes in midsummer, but its best showing in Arriyadh is during the winter, when it provides seasonal colour. There is a wide range of flower colours from light yellow, pink and red to nearly black. The leaves are almost circular and large, the size of a hand. The fruit contains many seeds. The root system is shallow, up to 40 cm deep, and roots are fine and fleshy. The plant prefers a well-drained soil with ample irrigation and likes full sun and regular fertilisation; otherwise, the leaves can be affected by rust. Seed propagation requires warm, dark and humid conditions. Flowers, seeds and roots can be used medicinally. A tea extracted from the flowers helps with coughs and inflammation of the throat: a tea from the roots is used for digestive problems. Hollyhock can be used as impressive accent plants in naturally designed planting schemes. If the flowers and fruits are allowed to remain on the plant until they are ripe, A. rosea seeds itself very easily, creating interesting and unexpected garden compositions. The plant should be pruned back to 15 cm above the ground in spring."

It is a tendril-climbing vine from Mexico that achieves a height of 12 metres. With its fast, vigorous growth, it easily takes over trellises, pergolas and fences, but also shrubs and small trees which it may kill. Shiny, evergreen leaves are about 10 cm long and arrowhead-shaped. Heat and full sun are accepted, but the soil should not be too dry. Deep watering encourages an extensive root system. Established plants survive with less irrigation. General-purpose fertiliser is tolerated, but highly nutritious soil makes Coral Vine produce vegetative growth at the cost of flowers. The floral display turns branches into festoons with bunches of pink flowers that highlight the mounds of deep green foliage and attract bees. Sometimes, cultivars are available. ‘Album’ has white flowers, while ‘Baja Red’ has magenta flowers. All flower in summer and autumn. Frost may cause the plant to go dormant. It quickly recovers, even if frozen to the ground. Maintenance is minimal if the location has been chosen carefully. Pruning is best in spring, especially if frost has killed twigs that require removal. The tendrils may need some initial support to reach the top of a wall or a pergola. Greater effort is required if the vine takes over its vicinity of pathways and slow-growing shrubs. The species is easily propagated by seeds, whereas the cultivars should be reproduced by cuttings."

"Riyadh","Atriplex leucoclada","description","There are some ten species of Atriplex growing presently in Saudi Arabia: seven are native (Atriplex coriacea, A. dimorphostegia, A. farinosa, A. glauca, A. halimus, A. leucoclada and A. tatarica), and three have been introduced and cultivated (A. canescens, A. semibaccata and A. suberecta). Atriplex is a halophytic plant which has developed various strategies to adapt to saline environments with excessively high salt content in the soil. Originating in the Mediterranean basin, A. leucoclada, known in Arabic as raghal, is a low perennial shrub with upright grey stems and triangular leaves and densely clustered, bell-shaped flowers and fruits, which appear on spikes in spring. The shrub grows in many different habitats, but it usually occurs on sabkah, coastal and inland salt marshes with a high accumulation of salts, and occasionally on silty soils. Frost-tolerant with a medium growth rate, the species is polymorphic, meaning that the shape and size of its leaves may vary according to season and habitat. A. leucoclada is an important species for agricultural use in arid regions. Atriplex species can be planted for soil desalination,   and CO2 sequestration. Studies have shown that Atriplex is able to survive sodium chloride salinity up to more than 100% of seawater salinity, indicating that A. leucoclada can be grown productively at moderate salinity. It is a useful plant for desert and extensive landscape schemes as a groundcover, occasionally requiring watering and maintenance to improve its appearance."

"Riyadh","Bassia eriophora","description","This is a native, halophytic species commonly seen on desert ground on saline and non-saline, sandy soils and in desert wadis in the ArArriyadh Region. Its Arabic name is umm haas. An annual herb with brittle branches and flowers on dense spikes in late spring, it becomes almost completely covered by a white, cotton wool-like fleece. Propagated by seed or annual self-seeding and perpetuating in situ, this is a plant for very extensive use in totally natural situations. When covering gravel or sand like a carpet, its woolly appearance makes it an attractive plant with a potentially high landscape value."

"Riyadh","Clytostoma callistegioides","description","The Lavender Trumpet Vine, native to Brazil and Argentina, is not often seen in Arriyadh, but certainly has great potential for garden use, as seen in many gardens in arid regions. It is also remarkably frost-tolerant to –7°C, although it will become deciduous and will generally recover, even when frozen to the ground, from its hardy, fleshy roots. It will do best in light shade, and reflected sun should be avoided. This vine will grow up to over 6 m long. The green leaves have two leaflets, and the pinkish-lilac flowers up to 8 cm in diameter have purple veins, appearing from spring to summer. Regular watering is necessary during the growth period and moderate for the rest of the time: overwatering should be avoided. Growing in most garden soils with good drainage, a deep, extensive root system should be encouraged and a general-purpose fertiliser should be applied in early spring, and then again in early summer. Propagation is best by semi-hardwood cuttings in summer, but scarified seed or layering are also possible. The cuttings strike easily. Pruning is best in late winter to control growth or to induce new growth from lower down. Chlorosis can be a problem, especially in spring. Generally pest- and disease-resistant, C. callistegioides is a very attractive vine with a tropical look, which will enhance a private garden where it has the space to develop. It grows particularly well over walls and fences: its tendrils attach themselves easily to chain-link fences, for example. It is also very suitable for shade structures."

"Riyadh","Carissa macrocarpa","description","This spiny shrub is native to South Africa. Its leathery leaves are shiny and oval with acute tips. Many sharp thorns protect the twigs, making planting close to walkways somewhat hazardous. Milky sap is secreted when the branches are injured. Showy, white flowers contrast perfectly with the dark-green foliage. They may reach 5 cm in diameter, are star-shaped, sweetly scented, and grow in clusters in spring and early summer. The fruit is a red, egg-shaped berry up to 5 cm long with a delicious, refreshing taste. The Natal Plum is frost-tender but revels in heat, and grows at a moderate speed to a height and width of 3 metres. In its home country, it may even become a small tree up to 9 metres high. It does well in full sun, but also tolerates some shade at the cost of flowering and fruiting. The glossy leaves resist desiccation from wind. Cultivars grow more compactly and remain shrubs of manageable size. They are ideal bushes for small gardens and are useful as screening hedges, groundcover, grouped planting or in containers. The soil should be well drained and neutral. To encourage establishment by an extended root system, watering must be deep. Both drought and soil with a high salt content are tolerated. General-purpose fertilisers are best applied in early spring after the plants’ dormancy. As a hedge plant, it takes shearing in spring after flowering, but recovers slowly from harsh cutting back. Recovering rapidly from frost, damaged branches need to be removed, which may spoil the shrub’s appearance."

"Riyadh","Chilopsis linearis","description","The desert willow, native to the U.S. Southwest and Mexico, is a graceful, deciduous, small tree growing up to 9 metres high with a similar spread. Its habitat is drainage channels, foothills and desert grassland at heights over 500 metres above sea level. Accordingly, it has good potential for planting in the Arriyadh region. With moderate to fast growth, the tree has slender branches and bright-green leaves 10 to 30 cm long. It bears terminal clusters of fragrant, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink and lavender from spring to summer. Relatively frost-hardy, the Desert Willow requires full sun and is very drought-tolerant: to improve its appearance and development, and also to prolong flowering, it should be deep watered once a month in summer. C. linearis will grow in most soils with good drainage. Propagation is by seed, cuttings, layering and grafting. This is a low-maintenance tree, requiring occasional pruning for shaping. Seed and leaf litter may be a problem, and, because it seeds easily, it may become invasive. This willowy tree with an interesting trunk makes an effective accent or specimen or a loose background plant. It is very attractive when planted in groups, and makes a pleasing textural contrast with other desert vegetation."

"Riyadh","Cupressus sempervirens","description","This well-known columnar Italian Cypress can be found throughout the Mediterranean and parts
of the Middle East. It is an evergreen conifer that reaches a height of 20 to 30 metres. The Italian
Cypress grows in limy, clayey soils that can be dry and poor, but must be well drained. This tree
is very erect and has a narrow, tapering column form. The tiny, dark, grey-green leaves are dense
and fine-textured. The stem is densely branched with erect branches. The bark is fibrous, thin
and grey when mature. The flowers and fruits or small cones are inconspicuous. Propagation is by
seed and cuttings. It withstands intense heat and aridity, responding well to deep watering every
month or two. In the ancient world, the cypress wood was treasured because of its durability.
With its elegant and unique vertical accent, it makes a very impressive specimen tree, especially
in formal gardens. It is also valuable as a tall screen, for high hedges, as a wind shelter and in
rows along roads or formal driveways. Too much fertiliser or even water will make the tree leggy
and floppy, spoiling the columnar habit. Some branches may require tying in. Care should be
taken in choosing the location where this tree is to grow, owing to its ultimate size. Attempts have
been made to grow C. sempervirens in Arriyadh, but they have not always been successful: it is
probably best in a wadi, park-like garden sheltered by other trees."

It is to be found throughout the Mediterranean, Middle East and on the Arabian peninsula, and is often seen in Arriyadh and the surrounding region. Like E. hussoni, it is a perennial, but a higher species growing up to 90 or 100 cm. The difference also lies in the flowers. ‘Spinosissimus’ indicates the shape of the long spines which protrude from the globed bloom. The spiny leaves are also much denser and pointed, in contrast to other Globe Thistles. Propagation is by seed. A very undemanding plant, it is useful for planting in desert conditions and extensive landscapes, where it can provide relatively dense cover on stony ground and is attractive in all seasons."

"Riyadh","Gazania rigens var. rigens","description","Treasure Flowers originate from the northwestern Cape, South Africa, and are now found both in warm countries as perennials and in colder climates grown seasonally. Peduncles of some 10 cm in length raise the solitary flowers distinctly above the leaves. The foliage is hairless on top but hirsute beneath. The flowers bear a ring of yellow, golden or orange rays which are sterile and centred by a black eye of fertile disc florets. The composite flowers may differ in size from 4 to 8 cm across. This variety is not known to grow wild, but from cultivation only. Gazanias grow well in poor soil and tolerate the frost that may occur in Arriyadh, where it is a very dependable groundcover. They can be used anywhere in gardens and parks as groundcover to hide dry earth. They are highly decorative in rock gardens and useful on embankments to prevent erosion. Gazanias tolerate a remarkable amount of salt in the ground. They quickly establish themselves after transplanting and tolerate drought. Maintenance is limited to lifting and dividing the plants when they become overcrowded. They may naturalise within irrigated areas, but rarely become weedy. Cultivars show many different colours within the same inflorescence, and some even double flowers. They easily hybridise to result in numerous variations that are hard to distinguish or to allocate. The name rigens means rigid, which may refer to the pointed bracts. Gazanias are pollinated by many different insects. The fruit is endued with long hairs that are easily dispersed by the wind."

"Riyadh","Pseuderanthemum atropurpureum","description","The Chocolate Plant, while commonly more purple than chocolate-brown in colour, is an upright shrub, up to 1 metre high; it originates from Mexico. Owing to its attractive foliage, it is seen more and more in gardens and parks in Arriyadh. The dark-green, shiny, oval leaves are brightly coloured with red veins, and the undersides are purple. Also very often seen is the variegated form, P. a. variegatum, which has waxy-looking leaves in hues of pale grey-green, rose-pink and white. The spotted, tubular-shaped white, pink or purple flowers are borne on short, terminal spikes and bloom for most of the year. The plant grows best in bright, indirect sunlight, is fairly frost-resistant and prefers some humidity. P. atropurpureum requires a fertile, well-drained but moist or sandy, alkaline soil, and should be watered regularly. Plants require fertilising every few weeks during the spring and summer. Propagation is by greenwood or hardwood cuttings. Prone to spider mites; nematodes, scale and thrips can also be a problem. The Chocolate Plant is an attractive plant for patios, garden borders and containers. It can also be used in parks, mass-planted or grown as a low hedge. It requires only a little extra care to maintain its appearance."

"Riyadh","Lonicera japonica 'Halliana'","description","Lonicera japonica ‘Halliana’ is the Japanese or Hall’s Honeysuckle. Honeysuckle is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan and Korea. The plant belongs to the vine family, and climbs to a height of 5 metres. For climbing, it needs a grit or fence in order to twine. The leaves are evergreen to partly deciduous in an ovate shape in light green. The delicate flowers attain a size of 4 cm. They begin to flower in bright white and turn deep yellow while withering. The flowers exude a pleasant sweet fragrance in spring and summer. After flowering, black inedible berries appear. Lonicera japonica is undemanding in terms of site requirements. It tolerates some drought, hot winds, poor soil and hot sun, and revels in heat. However, it can be affected by frost because it prefers temperatures above 1°C; otherwise it becomes deciduous. It will leaf out quickly again in warm weather. With constant adequate irrigation, it will look fresh and green. Although it is drought-tolerant, it will look mangy and sections will die out with lack of water. Periodic pruning is recommended for thinning and to control growth. Honeysuckle should not be planted too close to shrubs or trees, because it can take over. On hillside planting or as a slope stabiliser, it will control erosion. For Arriyadh, it is a recommended plant for screening, park plantations, public open spaces, urban areas in pedestrian precincts and the tops of walls. Quick shade can be gained for gazebos where the sweet, enchanting fragrance can be enjoyed"

"Riyadh","Myrtus communis","description","Myrtus is also called the Greek Myrtle; in Arabic, it is known as ass or hinbleiss. The Greek word ‘myron’ means balsam or odorous sap. It is a shrub of Mediterranean origin. The area of distribution reaches from the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean basin to southwest Asia. Often seen in Arriyadh as a hedge, the Myrtle reaches a height between 1 and 5 metres and a spread of between 3 and 4 metres. The shrub is often multi-branched and round in shape. The foliage is evergreen; the leaves are dark green, small and lanceolate. The blossom appears in summer and the beautiful white single flowers have attractive filaments. The flowers have an appealing scent and even the leaves have a good spicy flavour when they are rubbed. After flowering, the shrub develops, dark-blue berries. Maintenance with moderate pruning is advisable. The Myrtle is resistant to urban microclimates, and can be used as screen and shelter plant. It is suitable for pedestrian precincts, public open space and urban areas, and even for small managed roof gardens and as a topiary plant. The original distribution in the Mediterranean climate should again be considered, which means that the Myrtle loves sunny locations, but with sufficient air-humidity and irrigation. It is vulnerable in the case of desiccation and high salinity. The soil should be penetrable and rocky, but not limey. Myrtles can be used as specimen trees or dominant plants, as well as hedges. Myrtles will provide appealing compositions in rock or steppe garden themes."

"Riyadh","Nerium oleander","description","The Oleander shrub originated in the Balkans, Caucasus and Middle East with their Mediterranean climates. The Arabic name for Oleander is diflah. Oleander is an evergreen shrub growing between 2 and 3 metres high. The shape of the shrub is mostly round or oval, and multi-branched. The leaves lanceolate in shape. The flowers are grouped in an umbelliferous raceme, appearing in summer and quite enchanting. The variety ‘Album’ is distinguished by a brilliant white, ‘Pink Beauty’ in a fresh pink as the name implies, and ‘Sealy Pink’ flowers with a bright pink. After flowering, elongated star-shaped fruits appear. The root system is extensive. Maintenance of the Oleander is minimal and pruning can be done frequently to the base so it is able to rejuvenate from the ground up. All parts of Oleander are completely poisonous. Propagation can be done by sowing and pricking and by cuttings. The Oleander prefers a full sunny location and is moderately frost resistant. Irrigation should be moderate, because it likes moist soil. It can withstand a high salinity level. The shrub is heat-resistant and can withstand short-term desiccation. The shrub can be used as specimen, dominant plant, grouped or massed planting, and as a flowering hedge. Owing to the strong root system, it is suitable as a bank stabiliser and for environmental consolidation. In landscape design, it will produce good effects as shelter or screen plant. Park planting, public open spaces, urban areas and container planting are all possible with this attractive shrub."

"Riyadh","Prosopis chilensis","description","The Chilean Mesquite is a medium-sized tree, native to Chile, where it grows under extreme conditions, and for this reason it is also suitable for planting in Arriyadh, although it is not nearly as often seen as its relative, P. juliflora. Symmetrical, fast growing to 9 metres high and an equal spread, it has an open crown, is more upright than juliflora and has bright-green, fine-textured foliage with widely spaced leaflets. The twisted trunk has smooth bark when young, becoming darker and rough with age; some young specimens have very large white thorns. The flowers are moderately showy, cream- to yellow-coloured. Catkin flowers bloom in spring or early summer, followed by slightly curved pods 12 cm long. Trees require full sun, and reflected heat; they are frost-resistant, but will lose leaves with sharp cold and keep leaves in warmer winters. This species can grow in most extreme conditions such as saline soils and drought; little to no supplemental water after establishment, but occasional deep irrigation, will improve its appearance. It adapts to most soils with good drainage. Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Maintenance requirements are high owing to pod, flower and leaf litter, and pruning to remove crossing and sprouting lower, thorny branches. P. chilensis is a good choice as a shady tree for a garden or natural landscape. P. cineraria, almost native to the edge of the Ruba Al-Khali and Oman, is a further Prosopis species which could have potential for use in Arriyadh."

"Riyadh","Yucca gloriosa","description","Yucca gloriosa is also called Palm Lily, Roman Candle or Spanish Dagger. It is a lignified perennial with shrub characteristics. It is also a succulent and cacti type, similar to other Yuccas. Its climatic zones range from Mediterranean to subtropical. This Yucca is native to the southeastern USA, and has a normal to slow growth rate. The leaves are often ground-based and whorled, but the plant will develop stems too. It reaches a height of between 2 and 3 metres. The evergreen foliage is lanceolate and pale green in colour. The flowers appear in spring, borne on 60- to 90-cm panicles, and are white, pale yellow or pale purple. Cylindrical capsule fruits then develop, initially green and turning black as they ripen. The Yucca is propagated by sowing and pricking, and by cuttings. The root system is fleshy and extensive. The Yucca has no special requirements when it comes to site conditions. It can withstand high salinity, but not stagnant water. This is the hardiest Yucca, surviving frost down to –25°C. In landscape design, it can be used as a dominant plant in groups or as massed planting, and will also look attractive in rock and steppe gardens. Yucca gloriosa is suitable for planting in urban areas, public open spaces, as park planting, in pedestrian precincts, in containers and in private gardens. In Arriyadh, Yuccas can be found growing in a wide range of locations, for example in King Fahd Road. They are very suitable for harsh urban conditions."

"Riyadh","Zilla spinosa","description","Zilla spinosa is called silla or shubrom in Arabic. It is found in the Sahara-Arabian deserts in northern Africa, in the Middle East and on the northern to central Arabian peninsula. Z. spinosa is a shrub originating from arid regions which is well adapted to desert climates, and grows to a height of 60 cm. It is nearly leafless, thorny and dense-growing, mostly round in shape like a dwarf shrub. It has pale-blue to pale-violet flowers which appear in winter and spring, after which 5-mm seedpods develop. Propagation is by seed, or self-seeding. The branches and small leaves are olive-green. Zilla spinosa is tap-rooted, and grows in sandy, silty or rocky deserts. The shrub is highly salt-tolerant. In Arriyadh and the surrounding areas, shubrom can be found very often, e.g. in Thumamah Park. It can provide appealing design compositions with its light and shiny appearance and attractive, delicate blooms. In landscape design, it can be used as a groundcover, or for grouped or massed planting. In open country, it can be recommended as a coloniser, as a bank or slope stabiliser, and for environmental consolidation. In projects such as the rehabilitation of natural plant cover, it will be effective in seed mixtures for initial planting measures. Because of its pleasing appearance, it should also be considered for urban landscape design, such as for road verge planting. Irrigation will improve growth and flowering."

"Riyadh","Syngonium podophyllum","description","Native to tropical South America, the Arrowhead Vine is a lush plant for a private garden in Arriyadh that has a suitable microclimate. A perennial, evergreen, climbing plant attaining about 1.5 metres, it is more often seen as a creeping groundcover than a climber in a tropical garden. The attractive, patterned leaves are alternate, simple, arrow-shaped and often mottled; deep-olive-green leaves have prominent white veins. Numerous cultivars have been developed that vary in size, shape and colour, and the foliage of some of them is somewhat cream-coloured with green edges. Young leaves, divided into three, deep-cut lobes, are rounded at the tips and up to 15 cm long. When older, they can be up to 25 cm long and are divided into more segments. The flowers bloom on an elongated whitish spike. Syngonium requires moist, fertile, garden soil and a minimum winter temperature of 16°C. The plants also require high humidity, meaning that misting the leaves regularly, as well as protection from cold weather, is necessary in Arriyadh. They need strong but not direct sunlight, and abundant water from spring to autumn, with less in winter. Fertilising improves growth in spring and summer. Propagation is by cuttings or air layering. Syngonium species are often grown as house plants; they are also good container plants on patios. Climbing stems can be pruned away and the plant will become bushier and the leaves more attractive. The Arrowhead Vine is a high-maintenance plant requiring special attention for it to be grown in Arriyadh."

"Riyadh","Teucrium oliverianum","description","Teucrium oliverianum has the common Arabic name aihan or qasba’a. The English common name is Germander. It is native on the Arabian peninsula. Aihan is a subshrub and herb with long, erect branches. It reaches a height between 40 cm and 70 cm, growing like a dwarf shrub. The foliage is evergreen to semi-evergreen. The leaves are green on the top and olive-green underneath. The triangular leaves are entire and oppositely arranged. The bloom appears in spring, with beautiful blue-violet Lamiaceae flowers with long stamens. That and its shape make T. oliverianum an attractive ornamental plant. The plant develops nutlets as fruits. Propagation is by direct sowing. Aihan does not like salinity, but in all other characteristics it is completely well adapted to desert conditions and appreciates sandy, silty or rocky soils. Teucrium has no special irrigation requirements, although irrigation would optimise growth and flowering. Pruning will densify the shape. Teucrium can be found in Arriyadh and its surroundings, especially adjacent to dry run-offs. It is really eye-catching, and cannot be ignored. The abovementioned attributes make the Germander very valuable for landscape design in Arriyadh. It is recommended for use as a ground cover, massed planting, as borders or in rock gardens. This bee-attracting plant can be used in private gardens, or it has potential as an ornamental plant in the urban design. For open country, it should be used for the rehabilitation of natural plant cover."

"Riyadh","Acalypha wilkesiana","description","On suitable sites, these shrubs create dense mounds of showy leaves while the flowers are insignificant. Copper Leafs grow fairly fast to about 2.5 metres in height. The plant originates in the islands of the southern Pacific, where it withstands a considerable amount of salinity and still makes a lush tropical feature. High levels of humus and nitrogen are as important, as is frequent irrigation without waterlogging. However, fertilisation should not be applied until the roots have been established. Wind exposure and low humidity may result in burnt margins on the plant’s main asset – its gorgeous coloured foliage. Hues in bronze, purple and red make these shrubs an eye-catcher. Hardwood cuttings are the most common method for propagating the numerous cultivars. In spring, they root easily in mixtures of peat and perlite under some shelter to retain humidity. Varieties differ in the colour and shape of their foliage. To achieve a bushy shape, the tips of young plants should be pinched occasionally. In winter, they do well with less water. A range from full sun to partial shade is tolerated, but a lack of light makes the foliage colours fade. They grow fast enough to sometimes act as annuals in colder climates. As indoor plants, Copper Leafs develop better in soil-less potting mix that retains humidity yet drains well, and daily misting should compensate the lack of high rainfall, as in their homelands. Grown indoors, they are also susceptible to aphids, spider mites and scale insects."

Rings in lighter and darker green alternate horizontally, making this plant attractive all year round. In time, they become dense clumps up to 0.6 to 1.5 metre high. Several leaves form fan-like sprays and spread underground by rhizomes. They are easy to propagate by removing suckers or dividing mature clumps. Flowers are pollinated by moths, and accordingly the flowers open at night and emit a very pleasant scent. The flowering stalk may reach 0.9 metres height bearing pink buds that open to produce white cups. After the flowers are spent, the fan usually dies, but will soon be replaced by new shoots emerging from the fleshy rhizomes. Its drought tolerance makes this plant one of the toughest indoor plants and an impressive succulent for rock gardens, where it makes a dominant specimen. A small-scale plant for gardens, it does well in containers or in pool areas. This species is native to the scrub and light woodland of Angola. Recently introduced into Arriyadh, it revels in full sun, but does better in partial shade. The soil may be poor or contain moderate nutrient levels. Excellent drainage is essential, because the plant is vulnerable to stagnant water. Constant moisture results in root rot. The soil should be allowed to dry before being watered again. The plants will cope with hot, arid climates, and either acidic or alkaline soil."

"Riyadh","Convolvulus cneorum","description","The Bush Morning Glory is native to the western Mediterranean Basin. In Riyadh it requires a sheltered garden location; its relative C.mauritanicus is a potentially good ground cover, but both plants have a tendency to bare spots, which need replanting every few years. While most other Morning Glories grow twining this one remains a prostrate, compact bush of some 80 cm height and at least the same in width. The spread is often underestimated but should be respected since wide spreading roots impede transplanting. In late spring and early summer pink buds turn into white, trumpet-shape flowers with yellow throats and hues of pink. They contrast well to the silvery, evergreen foliage. It is lanceolate, hirsute and well protected against desert conditions. Leaves reach about 6 cm length and 2 cm width. Each year Bush Morning Glories show an impressive floral display. Flowers are some 4 cm in diameter and grow in panicles. In full bloom the shrub is almost entirely covered by flowers. This bush revels in heat and full sun and takes poor, sandy soil with good drainage. Clay soils have to be friable since over-watering kills the plant. Alkalinity and drought are tolerated. Plants are even found growing wild in rock crevices. It makes an area cover in steppe gardens or looks excellent as grouped bush in rock gardens when it sprawls over gravel and boulders. Unsightly plants can be renewed by cutting back to the ground in early spring. Sprinkler irrigation may cause powdery mildew. It takes urban climate, frost to about -7°C and some neglect when established. Softwood-cuttings root easily in late spring or early summer and sowing is also possible."

"Riyadh","Gazania rigens var. leucolaena","description","This is the toughest Gazania variety surviving frost, salinity and drought. These characteristics make it well adaptable to various habitats in its homeland, South Africa, but also in Arriyadh, where it is a very dependable groundcover. Although resistant to dry soil, it appreciates frequent watering in gritty soil that allows good drainage. It needs a place in full sun where the flowers open during the day to close at dusk. Bright-yellow flowers appear most prolifically from spring to summer, and occasionally in other seasons. Only few plants produce as glorious a show of colour as this Treasure Flower every year, under the most adverse circumstances. The plants creep moderately quickly with sparsely branched stems reaching some 40 cm in length. Its alternate leaves are about 10 cm long and 3 cm wide with an obovate shape. The name leucolaena is derived from the Greek word for a white cloak, referring to the tomentose leaves. It makes an ideal groundcover in a rockery, but its silvery foliage also contrasts well in mixed borders and beddings with massed plantings. On top and underneath, the leaves are woolly-hairy. After some years, this Gazania sometimes sheds older leaves at the base and needs either hard pruning to regrow, or otherwise the entire plant needs replacement. Some cultivars have been selected with an even more prolific floral display such as ‘Sunglow’ and ‘Yellow Star’. Treasure Flowers grow readily from seed sown in early spring. Cultivars are better propagated by division or cuttings both in spring or autumn."

"Riyadh","Lobularia maritima","description","Sweet Alyssum is a short-lived perennial native to the Mediterranean Basin and the Canary Islands. The generic name refers to the small seedpods, while maritima shows its preference for a maritime climate. It grows about 15 cm high forming lacy mats some 30 cm across. The lanceolate leaves are evergreen making the background for protruding terminal clusters of white inflorescences. They have four petals, as typical for the mustard family. Cultivars often produce flowers in lilac or violet for a long period of time. The flowers emit a very pleasant scent which attracts insects. After flowering, the plants should be cut back to restart their floral display. In containers, they make an impressive effect, spelling over the rim. They may be used for massed planting or edging and can cover empty ground wherever there is enough light. They tolerate full or partial sun and demand a well-drained soil. Other than these, the reliable Sweet Alyssum has no further particular requirements. Heat is tolerated, as are low temperatures, and irrigation may be done with some level of salt. The plant thrives even in crevices, still producing flowers in abundance. However, it also responds well to frequent watering and fertilising with slow-release granules. Sowing on site is possible in autumn, but more often plants are started in pots. After transplanting, it should be given some attention until it becomes established. In suitable locations, it may self-seed. It is most often seen in Arriyadh as part of a winter colour display on road verges."

"Riyadh","Drosanthemum hispidum","description","This mound-forming Rosea Ice Plant is native to South Africa and Namibia, which also makes a resilient ground cover in Arriyadh. First, it forms a ground-hugging mat some 20 cm high that eventually grows a centred bump of up to 60 cm high and 1 metre across. The grey-green foliage and the stems feature papillae that look like dewdrops for which it was alternatively named Dew Flower. Evergreen leaves are arranged oppositely and may reach 3 cm in length. Pink star-shaped flowers with a diameter of 3 cm cover this succulent perennial in spring. This Ice Plant demands well-drained soil, appreciates regular watering in summer and loves full sun. Light frost does not show any damage, since this plant belongs to the hardiest genus amongst the iceplant family (Aizoaceae, previously known as Mesembryanthemaceae). More than 100 species belong to the genus Drosanthemum, but only a few are cultivated, of which this is the favourite. Most members of this genus and even the entire family are called Ice Plants for the glittering surface of some species’ leaves. Soils may be low in nutrients and high in salinity, but waterlogging is not tolerated and will soon kill the plant. Sowing results in types that vary in flower colour ranging from mauve to almost white, and this offspring may also have flowers 5 cm across. More often, Ice Plants are propagated by cuttings. They look best trailing along rocky slopes and do not require any maintenance if their growth conditions are met. Some shade is tolerated, but may reduce the floral display."

"Riyadh","Saritaea magnifica","description","The Glow Vine is a spectacularly flowering, wide-spreading, climbing plant in the trumpet vine family, native to Colombia and Ecuador; it can also be shaped into a large shrub, with a bare stem and thick crown. A free-growing vine up to 6 metres long, it has dark-green, dense foliage. S. magnifica will grow in the protected environment of a garden in Arriyadh. The stems are almost round in cross-section, and marked with longitudinal stripes. The elliptical, smooth, leathery leaves have two unequal leaflets with rounded ends, and another two leaflets at the base of the stalk. They have an orange-red colouring during the winter. The magenta, scented panicles of large, bell-shaped flowers, have hairy, yellow throats and magenta nectar lines. These bright flowers appear from spring to autumn. The fruit is a long, flattened capsule. Glow Vine prefers cultivated, deep, but well-drained, moist soil with plenty of humus. Propagation is from seed and cuttings. It requires a hot, sunny position with some light shade, especially in Arriyadh; it is also frost-tender and needs protection from the wind. Regular watering is necessary, and deep watering every four weeks in summer is vital. Mature organic fertiliser added to the soil every year in spring is recommended. S. magnifica is prone to fungal diseases, which should be treated pre-emptively with a systemic fungicide; an insecticide should be applied to prevent the attack of aphids and cochineals before the hot weather begins. Otherwise, the Glow Vine needs little maintenance."

"Riyadh","Prosopis alba","description","The Argentine Mesquite is a semi-evergreen, upright, vase-shaped tree with a broad canopy, which grows to 10 m in height and spread. P. alba together with P. chilensis and P. juliflora were introduced into the Kingdom and Gulf States as roadside trees, and for other ornamental purposes. This handsome tree is well adapted to arid habitats, and has been seen to grow well in Arriyadh. Its short trunk has a thin, greyish-brown bark. Delicate, bluish-green, bipinnate leaves with paired leaflets are more closely spaced than those of other Prosopis species. The tiny flowers, which attract bees, are yellowish catkins which bloom in spring; fruit pods are up to 20 cm long and generally highly curved. Stems and trunks sometimes bear large thorns in a zigzag fashion; the bark is dark and rough. Trees require full sun and reflected heat, and will grow in poor, alkaline, saline soils and have deep roots reaching the water table. Requiring no irrigation after establishment, periodic deep watering improves appearance. They cannot withstand a series of heavy frosts. Propagation is by seed and cuttings. Maintenance requirements are high, owing to pod, flower and leaf litter, and the plants need training, secure staking and pruning in late summer for a strong structure. P. alba has landscape value as a small shade tree, in street medians, buffer zones, screens and windbreaks, and is effective in parks, but is not suitable for lawns. Possible problems and other cultural requirements are the same as for P. juliflora."

"Riyadh","Ricinus communis","description","Ricinus communis has the common name of Castor Oil Plant: in Arabic, it is known as al kharwah. The area of distribution extends across Burma, northern Asia and northwest China. This annual shrub-like plant prefers tropical to sub-tropical climates, and is not frost-tolerant. Ricinus communis grows fast, and reaches a height of between 2 and 3 metres. It is often multi-stemmed. The leaves are mainly green and sometimes appear as dark red; they are whorled, entire and palmate. The flowers appear in summer in panicles with red-brown, hirsute globes. The plant is very impressive in its appearance. The fruits are capsules that contain seeds which look like ticks. The plant is named after its seeds. All parts of the plant are highly poisonous, especially the seeds. The oil from the seeds is not poisonous, and was used as a remedy. The irrigation and nutrient requirements are high. In Arriyadh, the plant can be found growing wild in the Wadi Hanifah close to the water course. Because of its poison, it is often removed, although for some this is an attractive ornamental plant; in Europe, it is used as a summer bedding plant. However, it must doubtless be controlled because of its invasive character. Susceptible to insect attack, propagation methods are direct seeding or sowing and pricking out. In landscape design, it can be recommended as a background plant. This bee-attracting plant can be planted for foliage effects in public open spaces and parks, bearing in mind that its seeds are poisonous. It also looks well in containers."

"Riyadh","Tabebuia rosea","description","The Pink Trumpet Tree is a very beautiful, flowering tree in its native habitats of South America; in certain situations in Arriyadh, such as the King Abdulaziz Historical Centre, where the microclimate is suitable, it has become an attractive addition to the planting palette. Fast growing and deciduous, it will reach a height of up to 25 metres, in Arriyadh much less; it has a wide crown with thick, layered branches. The bark can be grey to brown and vertically fissured. Dark-green leaves are compound and finger-like: each leaf has five leaflets, the middle one being the largest. The tree begins to drop its leaves at the end of a hot, dry summer; large, purplish-pink to nearly white flowers, measuring almost 7 cm across, open in early spring. Long and slender seedpods contain many winged seeds. Fallen flowers retain the pink colour, forming a colourful carpet beneath the tree. In an arid location, the tree flowers very profusely. A moderately drought-resistant tree, T. rosea grows well in deep rich, well-drained sandy soil with variable pH values, but requires regular, abundant irrigation. It can be damaged by frost. Pests and diseases have not been observed. Propagation is by branch cuttings and seed. The Pink Trumpet Tree is a common and showy flowering tree in the tropics, and is often planted along roads, and in parks and gardens. It is an excellent shade and specimen tree for pathways. Maintenance is low: trees withstand a limited amount of pruning, but cannot be cut back hard."

"Riyadh","Thespesia populnea","description","Commonly known as the Portia Tree or Seaside Mahoe, this is a small tree originating in southeast Asia and found throughout the tropics. Since its introduction in Arriyadh a few years ago, it has been a successful tree. Growing rapidly, it reaches a height of up to 8 metres and a spread of 4 metres. The bark is brown and corrugated, while the twigs scaly. The shiny green leaves are heart-shaped, from 5 to 20 cm long. The cup-shaped, hibiscus-like, pale-yellow flowers are 5 to 8 cm in size, with a dark blotch at the base of the petals. Produced throughout the year, they last for one to two days, before turning maroon and dropping. The fruit capsule is a flattened leathery ball with greyish-brown seeds. The Portia Tree grows in many soil types including those based on quartz, limestone, and basalt; it favours neutral soils and sandy coastal soils, tolerating saline conditions. It requires full sun, is cold-sensitive, but withstands mild frosts and resists wind. T. populnea is drought-tolerant, but requires regular irrigation in summer in Arriyadh. It is easily propagated from scarified seed and cuttings. Pests are not generally observed. Used for medicinal purposes, this tree is much valued for its timber and for soil stabilisation and windbreaks. It makes a good, compact tree for gardens, patios and terraces, and can be planted in groups in parks or used as a shade tree for pathways. Easily kept in shape by pruning, only low maintenance is necessary."

"Riyadh","Pelargonium crispum","description","In South Africa’s Cape Province, it is possible to find Lemon Geraniums growing wild in scrub vegetation or light woodland. It is considered a sub-shrub for its herbaceous branches sprouting from a woody base to some 90 cm in height. Nevertheless, these upright bushes are also grown as annual plants in pots or beddings for combining attractive pink flowers with a pleasant fragrance. The crinkled foliage grows very dense so that plants are easily formed in any shape desired. The specific name refers to the texture of its foliage, since crispum means curly. When touched, the glandular, evergreen leaves release a strong lemon scent. They are cordate in shape and fresh green. In Arriyadh’s climate, where it makes a good garden plant, it should be protected from full sun and drying winds. Short dry periods are tolerated, but this species does better with frequent watering in well-drained soil. To guarantee appropriate moisture and allow aeration at the same time, the ground is best improved by adding compost and perlite. All-purpose fertiliser can be applied frequently. Lemon Geraniums do not take frost, extreme heat is best endured in semi-shade locations. Plants stressed by adverse growing conditions are sometimes infested by spider mites or mildew. Propagation by seed is started in late winter, while softwood cuttings may be planted in late summer. The main flowering period is spring to early summer. Some varieties have been selected with more showy flowers and another cultivar, ‘Variegatum’, features leaves with ivory margins."

"Riyadh","Arundo donax","description","Giant Cane, or ghab in Arabic, is a perennial grass which grows in both wet soils, primarily along watercourses, and relatively dry locations, where the conditions can be either fresh or moderately saline. Originally from Asia, it has been cultivated for thousands of years in southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. It is often seen in the Arriyadh region growing on the banks of small ponds or where there are culvert outfalls. A. donax can reach a height of up to 6 metres. The long, straight leaves are a lush green, and the flowers appear in late summer as feathery plumes, which are of a high aesthetic value in the wind when the sun shines through them from behind. Its rhizomes can spread invasively and create dense mats; the roots reach a depth of 1 metre. A small piece, split off the root mass, will root again further downstream, establishing a new plant. The plant is well adapted to floods and is easily propagated by rhizomes or seeds. The grass stems contain silica making them strong and flexible. They are also hollow and can be used as fishing rods and walking sticks, as well as for flutes. A. donax can be planted on the edges of lakes and ponds, watercourses or as a slope stabilizer. It is also used for wind shelter plantations or as a screen. Considerable maintenance measures are required where the plant has grown vigorously and the roots have become invasive; mechanical force is then necessary to reduce the stand."

"Riyadh","Asparagus densiflorus 'Sprengeri'","description","A mound of bright-green, ferny leaves make this Asparagus a very attractive perennial. Its rapidly growing, prickly stems trail down walls or may cover the ground, including more slow-growing neighbours. Insignificant, fragrant, white flowers are followed by red berries, which contrast well with the shiny, needle-like foliage. They are, however, considered poisonous. Botanical note: the leaves are what are known as ‘cladodes’ (modified branches), while the true foliage has degenerated to tiny inconspicuous scales. This South African native looks best in semi-shaded, rather protected locations. For a neat appearance, good drainage and soil with added organic matter are essential. It is drought-tolerant, but only for a short time. Fleshy roots allow a quick recovery, when leggy stems are cut back entirely to renew the plant or when the plant has been damaged by frost. Dividing the rootstock is the easiest propagation method or by seed. A. d. ‘Sprengeri’ has landscape value as a groundcover or foreground planting. The trailing stems are often used in floral arrangements, and this asparagus is frequently seen as a long-lasting indoor or pot plant on a patio. Chlorosis may be a problem in alkaline soils, but can be prevented by an application of ammonium sulphate or iron chelate. The low-maintenance measures include fertilising and periodic pruning."

"Riyadh","Bassia scoparia","description","The Summer Cypress is a fast-growing annual with soft foliage that resembles a Cypress tree. During summer, it has a lush impact with its fresh, bright-green leaves, while in autumn the colour becomes a showy reddish-purple. In Arriyadh, both colours are an attractive, seasonal addition to the garden and have some use in public green areas. The leaves, are arranged alternately and are linear in shape. It is more likely that it will establish itself on disturbed sites such as roadsides and ditch banks. The thin but dense foliage, on fleshy twigs, makes the plant vulnerable to heavy rain and wind. Inconspicuous flowers with green, leaf-like bracts occur in spikes during summer. Small, oval fruits contain tiny dark-brown or black seeds. Its attraction is its lush, egg-shaped appearance and the bright colour. The plant may reach a height of 1.3 metres if conditions are favourable. It may be grown as an annual hedge for low screening, or it can even be clipped to any topiary shape. On slopes, it may be planted to control erosion. Any soil is tolerated, but stagnant water kills the plant just as a single, frosty night might also do. Alkaline soils and high salinity are not a problem, but plants look poor in periods of prolonged drought. Seeds germinate within two to three weeks. Seedlings can be grown in pots first, or the seeds may be sown directly on site. Water frequently until established. Maintenance is minimal during growth, but after a short time the plants have to be removed. Summer Cypresses are not poisonous."

"Riyadh","Canna indica","description","Cannas are beautiful, herbaceous perennials, which provide a colourful display from red to orange and yellow, when their basic needs are met: rich soil with lots of humus and plenty of water. They originate in the humid tropics, where the more than 30 different types of Canna are native to Central and South America. New cultivars have been created, particularly those with almost black foliage, or very deep-coloured red flowers and variegated leaves. An outstanding feature is that they bloom almost non-stop throughout the year. The attractive leaves are large, broad, oval, veined and rubbery-textured on glabrous stems; the roots are tuberous rhizomes. Exposure to the sun is essential, although partial shade encourages stronger growth, and a lack of light may reduce flowering. Cannas may be propagated by seed, and the fleshy rhizomes of cultivars with their bright colours require division. All parts of the plant are frost-tender. Alkaline soils with a high pH may cause chlorisis. C. indica can be used as a potted plant, or planted in herbaceous borders, on the edge of ponds, and as a patio plant. They should be set about 50 cm apart and mulching the soil helps to keep in moisture. Clumps of Cannas look more natural than massed planting. High winds tear the leaves, and so a protected location is recommended, especially in Arriyadh, where leaf scorch could potentially be a problem. Dead flowers should be cut off to stimulate new flowers. Any ungainly leaves should be removed to the ground to encourage new shoots with lush foliage."

"Riyadh","Codiaeum variegatum","description","Better known as Croton, this evergreen shrub is widespread as a highly ornamental bush for the garden or as a popular indoor plant. It originates from India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Indonesia, where heat is accompanied by high atmospheric humidity and rainfall; hence, it demands abundant water. In Arriyadh, it withstands the sun and dry air relatively well, but requires a position sheltered from desiccating winds. The soil must be rich in humus and well drained. Crotons grow their colourful foliage in partial sun. High contents of nutrients and high temperatures may reduce the number of bright spots. Full sun bleaches the colours, while a lack of light results in greener leaves with less yellow or red spots. The intensely mottled foliage is shiny and attracts the eye from far, the major asset of Crotons. Plenty of varieties are bred such as ‘Petra’, with yellow veins and red shades alternating with green. Its white flowers are insignificant. Favourable conditions let it grow into a V-shaped bush of about 2.5 metres high and up to 2 metres wide. High levels of humus are important, and it should not be exposed to drying winds. Severe cutting back is possible in early spring, if frost has damaged the leaves. It does well in containers, is an ideal indoor plant and makes excellent focal points or colourful hedges. Stressed plants may occasionally be infected by mealybugs or scale. Both cuttings and layering make for strong offspring easily. In public gardens, it may as well be too exotic, but should be restricted to special sites."

"Riyadh","Solenostemon scutellarioides","description","The Painted Nettle is one of the most popular plants for interior greening, and is widely used outdoors where its conditions are met. They are tender perennials from southeast Asia found in shady, humid environments. If grown as bedding plants, they create masses of multi-coloured foliage to a height of about 30 cm. They are more valued when planted in mixed borders, where they grow twice as high to form a round, bushy eye-catcher. The variegation is outstanding, in shades of green, yellow, scarlet, red, pink and ivory. Terminal flower spikes feature azure florets that are usually pinched out, since the foliage is this plant’s main, spectacular attraction. In Arriyadh’s winters, Painted Nettles take full sun, but during the summer they are best sheltered, especially during the afternoons. Frost instantly kills this plant, and strong winds twist the leaves or entire branches. It appreciates fertile soil with ample water, but without waterlogging. It is very easy to grow in pots and containers. The easiest method of propagation is by placing cuttings in water or planting them in a mixture of peat, compost and sand with some cover to reduce transpiration. Sowing is an alternative in order to pick one of many colourful varieties, or to achieve random forms. They respond well to fertilising and do best with occasional pruning to rejuvenate the stems. Frequent pinching is recommended to form a denser habit. Their moderate to high maintenance requirements limit the use of Painted Nettles to well-kept gardens and pedestrian precincts."

"Riyadh","Cyperus involucratus","description","The Umbrella Plant is a grass-like, subtropical perennial native to southern Africa and Madagascar. Now regularly seen in Arriyadh, it was previously observed or was planted close to water, but now seems to have ‘escaped’ and has seeded itself successfully in drier soils. It grows upright culms with flat, linear leaves radiated on top. The plants are evergreen and grow to 1 metre in height. Ideal habitats are moist with a high nutrient content. Spreading rhizomes form huge clumps that may capture riverbanks and pond-sides. In summer, plain, brown flowers occur on top of the whorls. Umbrella Plants are grown for their picturesque appearance. They give a lush, exotic impact next to any kind of water feature. They are one of the few plants adapted to waterlogged sites, but also tolerate locations with average moisture, where they are less invasive. Partial sun suits them best. Frost kills the plant’s foliage but it revives as soon  as temperatures rise again in spring. They are readily propagated by seeds or may be divided at any time of the year. Maintenance is limited to the occasional removal of dead or unsightly leaves. If neglected in suitable environments, small, shallow ponds and swamps may be overgrown. Umbrella Plants are generally traded as Cyperus alternifolius or mistaken for their larger relatives, Papyrus. A dwarf type is Cyperus involucratus f. gracilis, with a height of some 30 cm suitable for containers and even pots to grow indoors. A cultivar called ‘Variegatus’ reaches about 1.2 metres and has white leaf margins."

"Riyadh","Euphorbia milii var. splendens","description","This succulent is native to Madagascar: it is often seen in Arriyadh in planters, usually with the intention of forming a barrier. Its edged stems are fleshy and able to store water while the foliage is not thickened. The obovate, dark-green leaves are found on new growth only. Male and female flowers are borne on the same plant, but both are inconspicuous. Nevertheless, a burst of colour is shown in spring by bright-red bracts. Sparse flowering appears during the other seasons too. It is attractive all year round for its strange appearance of thorny shoots that made it deserve the common name Crown of Thorns. Injured plants exude a milky, poisonous sap that can irritate skin. Pruning is not necessary, but is carried out to multiply the plant by cuttings. For this purpose, tips of 10 cm length are cut and placed in water until the sap stops flowing. Afterwards, they should be allowed to dry before being dipped in rooting hormone and placed in a mix of sand, perlite and humus. Excellent drainage is essential for mature plants too, since both waterlogging and overwatering by sprinklers kill the plant, especially in winter. Partial sun suits it best and extends the lifespan of the foliage. Drought is tolerated when the plants are established, but it also limits the endurance of the leaves. Slow-releasing fertilisers can be applied in spring to ensure a healthy appearance and an impressive floral display. Scale insects may infest plants on inappropriate sites. Frosts are not tolerated and immediately damage the foliage."

"Riyadh","Ficus microcarpa var. nitida","description","The Indian Laurel is another species of Ficus, which has largely disappeared from Arriyadh, owing to its lack of frost tolerance. Native to India,  it is often found in North Africa and the Middle East growing as a majestic shade tree. In Arriyadh, however, the species was formerly used to line many streets, and was often seen in clipped shapes on the lawns of parks during the 1970s (CE). Since then, the trees have slowly become less prominent in the city, as heavy frosts took their toll. It grows at a moderate rate to a height of 8 metres, and equal spread with strongly ascending, erect branches and smooth, glossy bright green leaves. Tolerant of many soils, it grows well in sand and does best in a fertile, moist soil. Tolerance to salinity is only medium. F. microcarpa var. nitida requires full sun and is tolerant of high temperatures and low humidity, although it thrives better with high humidity, as in Jeddah. It should be irrigated regularly in summer and will require deep watering only occasionally in the winter. Propagation is by cuttings and air-layering. F. microcarpa var. nitida is a variety of F. microcarpa (also known as F. retusa), which has larger leaves and longer, pendulous branches. Like many other Ficus species, its roots can be aggressive and buckle hard paving. Indian Laurel is prone to attacks by mites, mealybugs, thrips and scale. Suitable for gardens and containers, it is an excellent tree for public open spaces, and pathway shade, where the winters are warm and frost-free."

"Riyadh","Gazania rigens var. uniflora","description","The Trailing Gazania does not present as spectacular flowers as its relatives, but still makes one of the most useful perennials to have. It grows wild in South Africa and Mozambique; in Arriyadh, it is a very dependable groundcover. In parks and large gardens with adverse growing conditions such as dry, exposed sites, it performs better than other groundcovers. It grows prostrate and blankets the bare ground fairly quickly. The glabrous leaves are long and slender, appearing green in light shade, but somewhat silvery if fully exposed to sunlight. They persist in winter and withstand low temperatures and even light frosts, but they sometimes look poor in scorching heat. Drought is tolerated, but the plants appreciate occasional watering. In spring and summer, bright yellow flowers with centres in the same colour appear, measuring about 3 to 4 cm across. Removing spent flowers results in extra inflorescences. They close during the night and do not open on overcast days. After pollination, they develop fuzzy, white seeds. These readily germinate, but offspring may also be achieved by cuttings or division, when the stems root where they touch the soil. This Gazania is the ideal plant to grow over dry banks or to cascade over walls or edges of tubs. It may be clipped to shape, creating cutwork parterres. It is generally pest-free and resists diseases if good air circulation is possible. Flowers close if water is applied by sprinklers. On appropriate sites, the Trailing Gazania is almost maintenance-free."

"Riyadh","Hibiscus rosa-sinensis","description","Since it is no longer found in the wild, the origin of this plant is uncertain, although sinensis indicates a Chinese background. This was once a very common shrub in Arriyadh, but its susceptibility to frost, disease and insects seems to have made it rare. Various cultivars exist, with single or double flowers in shades of white, yellow, pink, orange and red. It is very easy to multiply Chinese Hibiscus by hardwood cuttings of 20 cm in length when the leaves are reduced to a third and the sticks are covered to retain humidity. Brief periods of frost may damage the twigs, but the bushes quickly recover and also flower within the same year. Annual cutting back, exhaust fumes and considerable dryness are tolerated, but they may result in slow growth and a reduction of flowering. Even some salinity is tolerated, but the leaves show chlorosis and may even be dropped. This species is usually evergreen and produces dark-green, shiny foliage. In its native habitat, Chinese Hibiscus flowers all year round. Elsewhere, flowers are produced when temperatures exceed 18°C. Above 25°C, the flowering is reduced, so that Chinese Hibiscus in Arriyadh flowers in spring and in autumn, but rarely in summer. In dry areas, the plants appreciate an occasional spray with the garden hose. Fertiliser should be applied frequently to encourage a prolonged period of blossom. When the leaves turn yellow between the veins, iron chelate is the appropriate remedy. Usually this chlorosis appears where the ground is alkaline and lacks humus."

"Riyadh","Ipomoea cairica","description","The Cairo Morning Glory grows creeping as a groundcover, trailing over edges or twining as a vine up to 5 metres high. This fast grower originates from tropical Africa and Asia, where it is sometimes called Mile a Minute Vine. Its stems are glabrous and tend to root when they touch soil. The evergreen, alternate leaves are pinnately lobed, round in shape and some 7 cm long. They form dense blankets spotted with many funnel-shaped flowers up to 9 cm across in purple, pink or white during summer. The fruit is a brown capsule 1 cm across with hairy seeds separated in valves. These are used for the most common way to propagate this plant and may also self-seed to naturalise on disturbed ground, preferably a moist site. Full to partial sun suits it best; however, it thrives in shade but refuses to bloom properly. Fertile ground and occasional fertilising is welcome. If the soil drains well, the Cairo Morning Glory grows rapidly with frequent irrigation and does not object to sprinklers. It grows tubers, from which it readily recovers if frost has killed the leaves and twigs. These tubers may be eaten cooked or roasted, but are not as tasty as those of its relative Sweet Potato (Ipomoea batatas). The twigs were formerly used to make ropes. It withstands hard pruning best in early spring, but does not demand much attention if there are no slow-growing plants nearby that might be overgrown. It is often seen in Arriyadh growing rampant over walls and fences."

"Riyadh","Pelargonium x hortorum","description","Garden Geraniums are hybrids of various South African species. They are small, erect shrubs with herbaceous branches on a woody base reaching a maximum of about 90 cm in height and some 70 cm in width, depending on the cultivars. Evergreen, fleshy foliage covers the plant densely. The leaf edges are lobed, and the dull green upper side often shows a ring of purple or brown. Terminal clusters of striking flowers are available in a wide range of colours such as red, pink, lilac, violet, orange and white. A single inflorescence usually consists of five petals, but double flowers have many more. Although the flowering climax is in spring, flowers may be seen all year round, if spent clusters are cut off frequently both for a neat appearance and to induce the development of new buds. Garden Geraniums enjoy sunny locations, but will also do well in partial sun. The soil should drain well and offer enough nutrients for the plant’s vigorous growth. The plant takes some drought, but looks best if watered frequently. Light frosts are tolerated, but severe cold kills the entire plant. Pruning can be done at any time to replace the brittle stems by young shoots. Cuttings can be taken both in spring and in autumn. Sowing is a year-round alternative. These Geraniums are the ideal plants for pots, containers and beddings. They enhance mixed borders with splendid colours and suit both public and private sites. Regularly seen throughout the year in Arriyadh, they are most prominent when they are planted for a winter colour display."

"Riyadh","Psidium guajava","description","From tropical America, this tender shrub has spread to all warm climates in the world. In favourable conditions, it may grow to a specimen tree of 7 metres in height. Veined, evergreen leaves are arranged oppositely on four-angled twigs. The emerging foliage is reddish to protect it from intense sun. When the reddish elderly bark peels off, it exposes light-grey bark beneath. A common tropical feature is flowers and fruit found on the tree at the same time. In Arriyadh, where the tree is often found in cultivation on farms, the white flowers appear mainly in spring, measuring about 2 to 3 cm across. Guaves are self-fertile, so that one plant does not need a neighbour for fertilisation. The fruits vary considerably in size, shape, colour and taste: they are between 5 and 10 cm in diameter, round or elongated, grey, white or pink, with more or less taste, either sweet or insipid. They turn ripe in autumn or early winter, emitting an intense pleasant scent. Guave fruits can be eaten fresh or processed to make juice and jam. Cultivars usually contain plenty of seeds within the pulp, but a few varieties are almost seedless. They germinate readily so that plants sometimes naturalise where conditions are met. In humid, warm regions, they may become weedy. Guave trees do well in full sun, but resent strong winds and reflected heat. Young plants are tender to cold, but mature trees tolerate brief, light frosts. Any well-drained soil is welcomed, either acidic or alkaline, but a high level of humus is appreciated."

"Riyadh","Tradescantia spathacea","description","Boat Lilies are stout perennials with upright shoots up to about 40 cm in height. They grow in clumps with lush-green leaves some 30 cm long. From beneath, the lance-shaped foliage is burgundy-purple, creating an interesting contrast. Their origin is southern Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and the West Indies, where they flower all year round. In Arriyadh, small flowers appear whenever conditions are favourable, from boat-like cradles to eventually develop to round seeds. These easily germinate to form plenty of seedlings, ultimately creating dense mats. It is possible to prick these offspring or take cuttings from stems or leaves to propagate Boat Lilies. They grow readily in a wide range of soils, as long as these are well-drained, and they tolerate diverse light conditions ranging from full sun to partial shade. Although these perennials re-grow after nipped back by frost, exposed sites should be avoided. In time, the plants become dense clumps which can be used as border plants, areal cover, mass planting or group planting with a spacing of between 30 cm and 60 cm. They do well in containers and are popular house plants, but they are susceptible to the effects of stagnant water and prolonged drought. A cultivar named ‘Variegata’ has cream-coloured stripes and less vigour than the species. It must not be exposed to full sun, because the variegation will soon be sunburnt. Plants should be handled with care, especially if cut or bruised, since the sap may cause skin problems."

"Riyadh","Ziziphus spina-christi","description","Ziziphus spina-christi has the common names Ziziphus and Crown-of-Thorns. This tree is indigenous to the east Mediterranean basin and southwest Asia. The Ziziphus has a normal growth rate and develops a dense, often multi-stemmed crown. The semi-evergreen foliage is green; the leaves are alternately arranged, entire and ovate in shape. The branches are armed with small thorns. Z. spina-christi reaches a height up to 14 metres, with a width of up to 9 metres. The root system is deep and extensive. The flowers are inconspicuous and umbel-like, with a light yellow-green colour. After flowering, the tree develops apple-like fruits with a size of about 1 cm. These are initially yellow, and later brown-red in colour. The tree is propagated by sowing and pricking, or by cuttings. Z. spina-christi is one of the best and most reliable trees used in Arriyadh landscape design. It can be found growing well everywhere in the city, e.g. in King Fahd Road, as a street tree in Murrabba and in Addiriyyah. It is completely adapted to harsh desert and urban conditions, needs almost no maintenance, low irrigation, little pruning and no added nutrients. It can withstand medium salinity, but does not appreciate stagnant water. The tree is very valuable for urban areas as a shelter plant, for public open spaces, street planting, parks and private gardens, and also for roof gardens and courtyards. The only thing that needs to be considered is the fruit drop. Ziziphus is good as a specimen tree and for afforestation and roadside planting."

Popular throughout the world in homes, offices and shopping malls, F. benjamina will withstand Arriyadh’s climate, but only when fully protected in a garden. In the past, it was occasionally found outdoors, but heavy frosts and scorching sun in recent years have caused its disappearance. With its dense foliage and gracefully weeping branches, it will grow relatively quickly in a favourable location to a height of 15 metres with equal spread. Glossy, dark-green, ovate leaves with pointed tips grow up to 10 cm long. The fruit is very small and red when ripe. In Arriyadh it is best in a warm-winter patio or garden in semi-shade. F. benjamina prefers deep, moist soils with good drainage and requires regular irrigation, more during the first years, and after establishment it will withstand short periods of drought. It needs wind protection when young. Propagation is by cuttings or air-layering. Occasionally cholorotic in Arriyadh’s soils, trees are prone to attacks by mealybugs. Expanding roots can be invasive and cause damage to underground pipes and paving; they also make it difficult for other plants to grow close by. As accent or focal point trees, they are also very attractive in containers. Trees can be clipped to shape and regular pruning will improve appearance, but pruning must be drastic if the branches are caught by a hard frost."

"Riyadh","Argyreia nervosa","description","A strong-growing, twining climber, which, with support, can reach the top of four-storey building facades, A. nervosa is a native of the Indian subcontinent, and has been introduced into many other countries in the tropics. It can often be seen in Arriyadh entwined in fences or tumbling over house boundary walls. The plant has very large, heart-shaped leaves and its flowers are hairy, trumpet-shaped, white outside with purplish-pink petals inside, appearing in cymes. While invasive, it is prized as a particularly attractive, resilient climber with pretty flowers. Traditionally, the leaves and roots of the plants have seen many medicinal uses. The plant is very slow-growing at first, developing into a compact bush, after which it becomes a liana. Without regular irrigation, it will die back and then regenerate with watering. Propagation is from the toughly coated seed, which requires nicking or soaking in boiling water for germination. Flowering often begins soon after germination with sufficient irrigation and plenty of space for root growth. Best in partial shade, leaves may scorch in full sunlight. For best results, A. nervosa should be planted in rich, well-drained soil; saturation will cause the plant to wilt and the roots to rot. Under good conditions, it will develop a massive root system. A strong trellis system or steel cables should be provided. The major maintenance effort inevitably involves disentwining the vine from places into which it should not be growing."

"Riyadh","Juncus rigidus","description","This is a dense, perennial rush, known in Arabic as sammar or nammas, which grows in tufts on saline ground in many parts of the Kingdom. These rushes are distributed throughout many parts of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Their habitats are salt marshes, poorly drained soils around water runoffs and permanently wet depressions, as well as the margins of watercourses and drainage channels. They grow to a height of 1 metre with a creeping rhizome and numerous rigid, slender and pungent stems. The pale-green leaves are sharply pointed, and mostly parallel. Panicles of numerous, small, beige flowers up to 20 cm long appear almost throughout the year. The capsules contain many seeds, which have whitish tails. J. rigidus prefers moist, silty soils and has a very high salt tolerance. Propagation is by seed and division. It is used as a material for making mats and is only occasionally grazed, if ever. This rush can be used for landscape purposes in extensive schemes, where the banks of lakes or watercourses need stabilisation. It is a very hardy plant, requiring little maintenance, although care should be taken that it does not become invasive. It is at its best near running water, but dead leaves should be removed when it is used in a garden around a pond."

"Riyadh","Stipagrostis plumosa","description","Native to Saudi Arabia and known in Arabic as nissi, S. plumosa is a perennial grass widespread in the desert, where it is important as fodder and also as a stabiliser of sand dunes. Growing in dense tufts up to 60 cm high, the stem branches densely from the base. Erect culms up to 30 cm long are glabrous and have woolly internodes. The fine, silvery leaf blades are 15 cm long and curled. Silvery flowers are borne on panicles up to 15 cm long throughout much of the year. The junction of leaf and leafstalk is a dense fringe of hairs. The feathery glumes at the base of the grass spikelets remain for a long time. Most common in spring, it is often overgrazed and then disappears. S. plumosa grows on shallow stable sands and sandy silt soils, and is highly tolerant of salts. Extremely drought-tolerant, watering would be necessary only after establishment, if its greenness needs improvement. Propagation is from seed. Nissi is an important grazing grass and is recommended for land reclamation and restoration of desert forage resources. It is very useful in erosion control. Owing to the very attractive aspect of the silvery spikes waving in the wind, it is an excellent grass for extensive landscape design purposes on a grand scale. It is virtually maintenance-free."

"Riyadh","Citharexylum quadrangulare","description","Citharexylum spinosum syn. quadrangulare is an evergreen, medium-sized tree, which grows to a height of 15 metres and is beautiful because of its long tassels of richly scented, white flowers. It has, no spines, but smooth, quadrangular twigs. The bark is light brown, and becomes fissured with maturity. Its common name is Fiddlewood and it is a native of the West Indies, where it generally grows in wet habitats below 500 metres elevation in agricultural, coastland and urban areas. Leaves are ovate and have orange petioles. They turn an orange-brown colour during the dry season, and without regular irrigation the tree can be deciduous. Flowers borne in racemes cover the tree from spring to autumn. The fruits are red to black drupes. Hardy to –6°C, C. spinosum requires full sun to partial shade and grows in most soils, preferring neutral to mildly alkaline, well-drained soils. Fiddlewood trees should not be overwatered. Propagation is best from woody stem cuttings or seeds. Easy to grow, and with its dark-green, shiny and ornamental foliage, it makes a good tree for landscape use. It does, however, have major disadvantages in that all parts of the plant are poisonous and it may become an invasive, noxious weed. C. spinosum is a tree that is now being planted in Arriyadh for its aesthetic appeal. Its roots are very aggressive. Regular pruning is necessary to shape trees. If removal of the tree is desired, it is necessary that the whole root mass also be removed, since C. spinosum will grow back quickly from a cut down trunk."

"Riyadh","Hibiscus tiliaceus","description","The Seacoast Mallow is found growing wild in subtropical, coastal regions of southern Asia. It is an ornamental tree attaining up to 10 metres in height and width and, owing to its provenance along watercourses, it tolerates stagnant water better than other trees. High salinity and even brackish water are tolerated. It grows fast in a variety of soils and tolerates some drought, but does not appreciate low atmospheric humidity combined with prolonged dryness. Leaves are heart-shaped, evergreen and make a dense crown. Bright-yellow petals form a cup some 15 cm across with a long carpel protruding from a crimson centre. After just one or two days, they are shed, so that trees are not ideal canopies for pedestrian precincts. Often, they turn orange or red before they are dropped. Apart from this bad habit, there are no further disadvantages, so that this species is often seen as an appealing street tree. Seeds should be stratified and soaked in warm water prior to sowing, and hardwood cuttings also grow readily to imitate the traits of the parent plant. The latter will also flower sooner than plants grown from seeds. The Seacoast Mallow is a vigorous plant that does well in containers. It withstands pruning and may be kept as a small standard or used as a hedge for screening. For flowering, it requires plenty of light, and frequent irrigation with occasional fertilisation is recommended. Light frosts may damage the leaves, but plants recover quickly. There is often confusion in Arriyadh between this plant and Thespesia populnea."

"Riyadh","Searsia pendulina","description","Several species of Rhus, which are native to arid regions such as the deserts of Arizona and Mexico, and also South Africa, have potential for use in Arriyadh. Renamed Searsia pendulina in 2008, the White Karee, originating from and now widely planted in South Africa, is a small ornamental tree which can be found in Arriyadh’s nurseries. Fast-growing and somewhat short-lived, it will reach a height of about 6 metres and a spread of 4 to 5 metres. It has a willowy appearance with a rounded crown, and many drooping, weeping branches, usually on a single trunk, the bark of which is smooth and greyish, becoming rough and scaly at maturity. The dark-green leaves are trifoliate. Small, yellowish-green flowers bloom delicately on branching panicles from spring through to summer, attracting bees and butterflies. (Male and female flowers are borne on separate trees.) The edible fruits are small round berries which ripen from red to black, and are eaten by birds. The plant prefers moist soil with good drainage, and flourishes in full sun: it is wind- and drought-resistant, and relatively frost-hardy. Propagation is easy from seed and cuttings. Regular irrigation is necessary until establishment, with deep watering later during the summer months. The wood is durable and is used for fencing poles. An excellent small garden tree for shade, the roots are not aggressive, so that planting at a reasonable distance from swimming pools or patios is not a problem. Because not much pruning is needed, it makes a low-maintenance street tree."

"Riyadh","Ficus microcarpa ’Panda’","description","This Ficus is a curiosity in that it is usually grown commercially as a bonsai tree. It was first seen in containers in Arriyadh nurseries and has been planted outside shops and restaurant windows principally because it grows compactly and can easily be pruned to shape. Often available in a spherical shape on a stem, F. panda shares all of the requirements of F. m. var. nitida, and the same applies to its ability to withstand frost and sun. It has light, almost round, thick leaves, which alternate up the stem and a brown to reddish bark dotted with small horizontal flecks. It can be propagated easily from cuttings. It suffers from several diseases, including black fly, scale, thrips and eelworm, as well as fungus and rot. Probably a variety of Ficus microcarpa, it seems to have originated in nurseries catering for indoor plants and was then exported to nurseries in the Gulf States, where it has thrived in the coastal climate and made an excellent hedge plant. In the US, two new forms of F. microcarpa entered the Florida trade in the mid 1970s (CE) under the names Ficus ‘Green Island’ and Ficus microcarpa var. crassifolia ‘Green Mound’. Both have been sold as Ficus ‘Panda’ or Ficus americana ‘Panda’ in Europe. They tend to spread out and are easy to train as a ground-hugging shrub. For best results, F. panda is best planted in a sheltered position, in the humid environment of a well-irrigated garden. F. panda is also a good screening or background shrub that needs almost no pruning to stay dense and trim."

"Riyadh","Argyreia campanulata","description","Native to India and southeast Asia, this tall, rangy and fast-growing shrub with multi-stems can grow up to 3 metres high. It is not planted in Arriyadh as often as it used to be, but is still occasionally found on farms. The large, heart-shaped leaves are dark green with velvety undersides. Numerous, large, funnel-shaped, pinkish-lilac flowers, appearing in clusters, last only a day or two, but the shrub is an all-year bloomer. Berry-like fruits produce many seeds. A. campanulata grows in many soils, especially well in sandy soil, and requires full sun. The shrub is drought-tolerant, but wilts completely after a long period without irrigation; it is also not hardy in a spell of heavy frost. Propagation is by hardwood cuttings. Pruning and irrigation should be carried out regularly to improve the shrub’s appearance. Valuable as a dense screen or informal hedge, the lush, green foliage and bright flowers make this shrub a valuable background plant for a park or large garden, or as a contrast in a desert scheme."
