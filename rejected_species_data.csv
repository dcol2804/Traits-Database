It buds up in autumn and then the deep pink flowers open through winter with contrasting white stamens giving an interesting pin cushion look. A great feature plant in a shrubbery or pot. Best suited to low humidity areas, high levels of humidity can lead to dieback. In humid areas it is best in a large pot where it can get plenty of air flow around the plant and good drainage. A light prune will help create a good habit.","description","A low spreading shrub that is absolutely spectacular when in flower.

These epiphytes do not take nutrients from the host tree but obtain most of their water and nutrients from the urn created by the rosette of leaves.This attractive plant has broad pale green arching leaves and a short spike of red bracts and yellow flowers that can last up to 6months.The strap-like leaves are leathery and have backward facing spines along the leaf margin. They are very sharp so take care when handling them, gloves are recommended.The leaves grow in a rosette formation creating a well in the centre that collects and stores water for the plant. When watering these always ensure that the well is filled with water as most of the water is absorbed through modified cells at the base of the leaves.Once the plant has flowered it will produce pups around the base of the plant. The pups will take nutrients from the dying parent plant and can be removed and replanted when they reach about a third of the parent.Aechmea pimenti-velosoi is a hardy species and it will grow in cooler climates, being able to survive a mild frost to about -2C. It also grows well in sunny and exposed sites.If you wish to grow them on a tree, place sphagnum moss around the roots before either wedging the plant in the fork of a tree branch or securing it to trunk using a semi-circular clip around the base of the young plant (Pup).","description","Aechmea pimenti-velosoi is an epiphytic perennial native to southern Brazil.

The leaves have very attractive markings and tend to be asymmetrical, generally ovate and have toothed leaf margins.The colour of leaves varies considerably with the darker leaf varieties requiring more shade, whilst the lighter leaf varieties will take a sunnier location.During spring and summer small flowers are borne on showy pendent clusters and can vary in colour, but all make a wonderful display.Cane Stemmed Begonia can be grown outside in tropical and subtropical areas though the majority prefer dappled light.There are some varieties, however, that can be grown successfully in full sun.For those living in cooler regions these lovely plants can be grown indoors.Included in this group are:Angel Wing Begonia Begonia coccinea;  have coral pink to red flowersBegonia aconitifolia  have pink or white flowersBegonia acutifolia have white flowers tinged with pinkBegonia dichroa  have orange flowersBegonia stipulacea  syn B. zebrina have white flowersVarious hybrids have become popular, including Irene Nuss, White Cane, Sophie Cecile and Looking Glass.","description","There are hundreds of species and related cultivars within the Begonia genus.

Leaf surface also varies from matt to metallic and hairy to smooth.  The patterns may be spirals, splashes, speckles, or intricate shapes in greens, creams, pink, purple, maroon and red to silver.Regardless of your taste you are sure to find a variety to suit.The flowers produced are small and inconsequential, in fact most growers remove the flower stalks before they flower.These can be grown outside in tropical and sub-tropical areas but tend to be grown inside where the amazing foliage can be enjoyed all year. They have a rounded growth habit and grow to about a maximum 30cm tall and wide which makes them a perfect size as a pot plant.","description","There are hundreds of species and related cultivars within the Begonia genus.

"Gardensonline","Cucumis melo Inodorus","description","Cucumis melo is a tropical, annual vine that has been cultivated and hybridised into many varieties, including well known smooth skinned varieties like honeydew and casaba, along with cantaloupes.Honeydews are usually round or oval with a smooth skin that can vary in colour from yellow to white and grey. The flesh colour is generally greenish, moist and sweet and has thick rows of seeds in the centre.Cantaloupes tend to be rougher skinned with sweet, orange flesh.Melons grow as spreading stems that cling to anything they touch via springy tendrils. Their large, lobed leaves are coarse, hairy and medium to deep green in colour.Attractive yellow, funnel-shaped flowers appear when the vines reach maturity, but the flowers are monoecious which means that separate male and female yellow flowers appear on each vine.The pollen producing male flowers open first, soon followed by the female flowers which  produce the melons.Each female flower must be pollinated by bees for the fruit to set, so be sure to encourage these productive insects in your garden.They take an average of 90 to 110 days to produce harvestable fruit.","description","Cucumis melo is a tropical, annual vine that has been cultivated and hybridised into many varieties, including well known smooth skinned varieties like honeydew and casaba, along with cantaloupes.Honeydews are usually round or oval with a smooth skin that can vary in colour from yellow to white and grey.

Most of the water used by the plant is taken up via the leaves from water in this central leaf well.When the plant is 2-3 years old it produces a flattened sword-shape flower-head of bracts on an upright flower stalk.  The tubular flowers appear between the bracts tend to be a contrasting colour. The bracts will last for several months but the delicate flowers for only a few days.Most commonly the flower has bright red bracts and tubular shaped flowers in a contrasting colour, usually yellow.As with all Bromeliad, the parent plant dies after flowering and at the same time new plants or pups are developing at the base of the parent, they will continue to grow and take nutrients until the parent has died completely or they have been removed.These wonderful plants make an attractive addition to any tropical garden where they will grow well under (or in) trees or other partially shaded areas and especially well as part of a fernery.They can be grown inside on a piece of bark or in orchid or epiphytic bromeliad potting mix.

"Riyadh","Agave angustifolia 'Marginata'","description","This Agave is the right choice for locations that are limited in size. It is easier to manage than its larger relatives. The stiff, lanceolate foliage is armed with terminal spines and features cream-coloured edges with small serrations Leaves grow to some 50 cm length and about 10 cm width. Like other species, the Variegated Caribbean Agave may take many years to flower. This event only occurs once, and the rosette dies back entirely when a flower stalk of some 2.5 metres shoots up. Single flowers are borne in greenish-yellow and are 5 cm in length. Seedlings usually do not show any variegation, so that plants are generally propagated by suckers that are grown in abundance. This agave grows in full sun and, it is drought-resistant. It does best in well-drained soil with occasional watering, and other soils should be allowed to dry between water applications but before the plants start to wilt. It is well suited to containers and lasts for years in rootbound conditions. On the other hand, plants are vulnerable to stagnant water, especially when associated with low temperatures. Hard frost is not tolerated and immediately results in wilted leaves that do not recover. Plants are rarely infested by diseases or pests, but in adverse conditions they may be afflicted by scale. Variegated Caribbean Agaves look highly impressive in pots or containers and make valuable accent plants in smaller rock gardens or in any situation where greening must tolerate some neglect. Attractive specimens may be seen in the Diplomatic Quarter.","description","This Agave is the right choice for locations that are limited in size. It is easier to manage than its larger relatives.

"Riyadh","Citrus limon 'Trunj'","description","This variety of the lemon tree is also known locally as trunj, and is probably the hybrid named 'Ponderosa': it is often seen on farms in the Riyadh region. It is, however, relatively frost-tender and the trees may be damaged by drying winds or prolonged cold. Bearing highly ornamental fruit of extraordinary size of more than 20 cm, twigs may be bent down by the weight of many huge lemons. The tree grows fast up to 3 metres high, bears fruit early and has an angular shape with large leaves. It can be trained on a trellis to stabilise the branches and to prevent damage. Young plants are delicate and cannot compete with weeds. 'Trunj' requires a well-drained, sandy and fertile soil, with regular watering until established. Complete NPK fertilisers should be applied in early spring. Citrus trees have the attractive tropical feature of producing flowers and fruit at the same time. The fruit does not have any particular commercial value, but the non-acid lemons have a thick, bumpy rind that can be used for producing jam. The rind is low in essential oils, but gives off an aromatic scent and is sometimes candied or preserved in brine. Pruning should be limited to removing water sprouts, usually the result of severe cutting back of the branches of older trees. Most of these shoots are short-lived anyway and leave unsightly sticks on the branches. Deadwood might be provoked by prolonged drought or waterlogging. Like all citrus, the trees suffer from attacks by mealybugs, aphids and often have mildew.","description","This variety of the lemon tree is also known locally as trunj, and is probably the hybrid named 'Ponderosa': it is often seen on farms in the Riyadh region.

"Riyadh","Asparagus densiflorus 'Sprengeri'","description","A mound of bright-green, ferny leaves make this Asparagus a very attractive perennial. Its rapidly growing, prickly stems trail down walls or may cover the ground, including more slow-growing neighbours. Insignificant, fragrant, white flowers are followed by red berries, which contrast well with the shiny, needle-like foliage. They are, however, considered poisonous. Botanical note: the leaves are what are known as ‘cladodes’ (modified branches), while the true foliage has degenerated to tiny inconspicuous scales. This South African native looks best in semi-shaded, rather protected locations. For a neat appearance, good drainage and soil with added organic matter are essential. It is drought-tolerant, but only for a short time. Fleshy roots allow a quick recovery, when leggy stems are cut back entirely to renew the plant or when the plant has been damaged by frost. Dividing the rootstock is the easiest propagation method or by seed. A. d. ‘Sprengeri’ has landscape value as a groundcover or foreground planting. The trailing stems are often used in floral arrangements, and this asparagus is frequently seen as a long-lasting indoor or pot plant on a patio. Chlorosis may be a problem in alkaline soils, but can be prevented by an application of ammonium sulphate or iron chelate. The low-maintenance measures include fertilising and periodic pruning.","description","A mound of bright-green, ferny leaves make this Asparagus a very attractive perennial.

"Riyadh","Ficus microcarpa ’Panda’","description","This Ficus is a curiosity in that it is usually grown commercially as a bonsai tree. It was first seen in containers in Arriyadh nurseries and has been planted outside shops and restaurant windows principally because it grows compactly and can easily be pruned to shape. Often available in a spherical shape on a stem, F. panda shares all of the requirements of F. m. var. nitida, and the same applies to its ability to withstand frost and sun. It has light, almost round, thick leaves, which alternate up the stem and a brown to reddish bark dotted with small horizontal flecks. It can be propagated easily from cuttings. It suffers from several diseases, including black fly, scale, thrips and eelworm, as well as fungus and rot. Probably a variety of Ficus microcarpa, it seems to have originated in nurseries catering for indoor plants and was then exported to nurseries in the Gulf States, where it has thrived in the coastal climate and made an excellent hedge plant. In the US, two new forms of F. microcarpa entered the Florida trade in the mid 1970s (CE) under the names Ficus ‘Green Island’ and Ficus microcarpa var. crassifolia ‘Green Mound’. Both have been sold as Ficus ‘Panda’ or Ficus americana ‘Panda’ in Europe. They tend to spread out and are easy to train as a ground-hugging shrub. For best results, F. panda is best planted in a sheltered position, in the humid environment of a well-irrigated garden. F. panda is also a good screening or background shrub that needs almost no pruning to stay dense and trim.","description","This Ficus is a curiosity in that it is usually grown commercially as a bonsai tree.

Often available in a spherical shape on a stem, F. panda shares all of the requirements of F. m. var. nitida, and the same applies to its ability to withstand frost and sun. It has light, almost round, thick leaves, which alternate up the stem and a brown to reddish bark dotted with small horizontal flecks. It can be propagated easily from cuttings. It suffers from several diseases, including black fly, scale, thrips and eelworm, as well as fungus and rot. Probably a variety of Ficus microcarpa, it seems to have originated in nurseries catering for indoor plants and was then exported to nurseries in the Gulf States, where it has thrived in the coastal climate and made an excellent hedge plant. In the US, two new forms of F. microcarpa entered the Florida trade in the mid 1970s (CE) under the names Ficus ‘Green Island’ and Ficus microcarpa var. crassifolia ‘Green Mound’. Both have been sold as Ficus ‘Panda’ or Ficus americana ‘Panda’ in Europe. They tend to spread out and are easy to train as a ground-hugging shrub. For best results, F. panda is best planted in a sheltered position, in the humid environment of a well-irrigated garden. F. panda is also a good screening or background shrub that needs almost no pruning to stay dense and trim.",
